officials believe they need to do so without setting firm deadlines for reducing or withdrawing american troops a practice president obama embraced but which trump officials assert denied the military

it also suggests that policy makers at the federal reserve will stick with their plan to gradually raise interest rates while shrinking the central bank s balance sheet but the expansion camouflages some more profound shifts just under the economy s surface sectors like technology health care and banking are thriving even as industries like retail shed jobs and while the 44 percent unemployment rate is the lowest in a decade wage growth remains frustratingly slow and the fortunes of collegeeducated workers have diverged sharply from those with a high school diploma or less the stock market has also been soaring and the housing market is similarly robust in many parts of the country especially in coastal areas like new york washington san francisco and boston in the latest quarter the economy benefited from steady consumer spending and an improving trade balance while less robust state and local spending along with slower inventory growth worked as headwinds demand from shoppers for durable goods like automobiles appliances and furniture contributed more than a full percentage point to growth another bright spot lately has been the dollar s decline against other currencies

those hopes came down to earth however amid moderate spending by consumers which accounts for roughly twothirds of all economic activity and with deep divisions on capitol hill between republicans and democrats as well as within the republican majority itself underscored early friday by the senate rejection of a health care bill hopes have faded for the kind of big infrastructure program or comprehensive tax reform mr trump has promised at most we are expecting a slight cut in corporate tax rates next year not big cuts ms swonk said it won t be the kind of sweeping reform we need the infighting both within the white house and both political parties exceeds the partisan gridlock we ve become accustomed to she added infrastructure spending seems to have fallen off the radar screen in the second half of the year economists like michael gapen of barclays are predicting growth will remain in a range of 2 percent to 25 percent the economy remains in a modest growth path and last quarter was driven by gains in household and business spending mr gapen said the surprise came in the area of trade where it looks like solid growth outside the us and a weaker dollar boosted exports mr gapen added this is a turnaround from last year when a stronger dollar was a drag on growth advertisement continue reading the main story the figure released on friday is the first of three estimates that the commerce department will provide on growth in april may and june the final number could be revised higher or lower depending on factors like consumer spending business investment factory orders and imports and exports the white house has said that its longterm target for growth is 4 percent and mr trump has repeatedly said that the economy could grow faster if regulations were rolled back and trade policies were toughened to encourage american companies to manufacture more of their products in the united states but many economists say that goal is unrealistic given fundamental factors like an aging population and the retirement of the baby boomers along with years of slow productivity gains the last time annual economic growth topped 4 percent was in 2000 at the end of the techfueled boom of the late1990s since then the american economy s best annual performance was in 2005 just before the bursting of the housing bubble when annual growth was 33 percent we could grow slightly faster than we are now if you had comprehensive tax reform and a 10year infrastructure spending program mr gapen said that could get us to 25 percent growth per year or slightly better but 4 percent is highly unlikely

that chinese companies have also carried out extensive economic espionage through cyberattacks and other means chinese officials have denied those charges more recently china has used its growing wealth to buy into cuttingedge technologies like genetically modified crops and the latest innovations from american startups and to attract promising talent but since those early days china has relied heavily on one triedandtrue method forming joint ventures with foreign partners bigname companies like ibm and qualcomm are required to share advanced technology and research with domestic

revenues from homegrown companies the made in china 2025 initiative is a key reason the country is improving intellectual property rights the plan focuses on sectors like electric cars robotics semiconductors and artificial intelligence by forcing foreign companies to hand over more technology and encouraging local companies to make new products based on that technology chinese leaders hope to cement the country s dominance in critical fields they also see an opportunity to dictate the terms of the future development of technology and extract licensing fees from foreign firms that use

photo you re a former republican communications strategist who worked for george w bush john mccain and sarah palin and now you have a show on msnbc what s it like on that side of the table i was always the squishy one on the bush white house staff no one i worked for was ever deceived by my degrees of conservative principles and that was my value to them i understood the other side i helped most of the people i worked for soften their polarizing edges but to say that i would be totally unemployable in today s political climate is probably an understatement that s just not what any of them do what do you think it s like working at the white house right now there s a pretty high level of alarm based on how easy it is to get people to talk about what s actually happening inside the white house and you never know the whole story as chaotic and dysfunctional as it looks from the outside from my experience with sarah palin i know what s known and discussed publicly is usually just the tip of the iceberg do you think we still know only the tip of the iceberg with palin well what i think was unknown was the degree of her rejection of us asking her to do anything that wasn t her own idea we were dealing with someone who was maybe ahead of her time her irreverence and disdain for the establishment of her own party and her embrace of the isms nativism isolationism you know she blew the walls out on the political norms before donald trump did she was obviously onto something she had crowds five times the size of mccain s we think it was all about her political skills but it was also about her message she railed against the mainstream media she attacked all of us her own advisers that her audiences were so enthusiastic about that was the early signal that the party had changed wallace is the host of deadline white house on msnbc and a contributor to the today show she was a white house communications director under george w bush age 45 occupation political analyst and television anchor hometown orinda calif her top 5 political movies 1 dave 1993 2 the american president 1995 3 bulworth 1998 4 primary colors 1998 5 all the presidents men 1976 many people think that because of trump s volatility we re experiencing potentially unpredecented political destabilization how do you think this administration stacks up to the bush white house before 911 bush spent the first seven or eight months of his presidency trying to work in a bipartisan manner he passed the education bill with ted kennedy s support he passed the tax cut with max baucus s support i mean he had some relationships on the other side and then obviously the attack brought everyone together probably for too brief a time trump went on twitter and attacked a republican his sitting attorney general and the acting director of fbi all before 11 am today if something happened in the national security realm he d need them to assist him in protecting the country it s almost like that part of the job hasn t been explained to him he s just there trying to do what he thinks the president part is do you have any advice for people who have to work for president trump they have to have their own red line and live by it maybe it s attacking a morning anchor for her plastic surgery i don t know what it is it s way beyond what i would stay and tolerate everyone needs to have a limit then keep their head down and try to do their job until and unless that limit is reached only donald trump s white house could make the bush years look like the golden age of presidential history what do you think you d be covering if you didn t cover trump one of the symptoms of the time of trump is that there s no other news i sometimes think if there were another arab spring how would we cover it i don t know it s an impossible question to test because you can t remove trump and see what we would do without him but it s an interesting question you ve talked about how your parents voted for trump have they changed their views of him we don t talk about politics anymore

at an hourlong meeting last wednesday all of the president s major security advisers recommended he preserve the iran deal for now among those who spoke out were secretary of state rex w tillerson defense secretary jim mattis lt gen h r mcmaster the national security adviser and gen joseph f dunford jr the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff according to an official who described internal discussions on the condition of anonymity the official said mr trump had spent 55 minutes of the meeting telling them he did not want to mr trump did not want to certify iran s compliance the first time around either but was talked into it on the condition that his team come back with a new strategy to confront tehran the official said last week advisers told the president they needed more time to work with allies and congress mr trump responded that before he would go along they had to meet certain conditions said the official who would not outline what the conditions were while mr trump headed to paris and then spent the weekend in new jersey his team developed a strategy that it hoped would satisfy him and planned to notify congress and make the case publicly on monday but even as allies were quietly being informed mr trump balked when he heard the plan at his morning security briefing the official said the argument continued during a separate meeting with mr tillerson as mr trump pressed for more action the official said suddenly a background briefing to announce the decision was postponed and mr spicer was sent out to assure reporters that a decision would be coming very shortly while aides scrambled to satisfy mr trump he agreed only late in the day after a final meeting in the oval office in effect telling his advisers that he was giving them another chance and this time they had to deliver the announcement was then rescheduled for the early evening and a notice was sent to congress to continue withholding nuclearrelated sanctions against iran video under the agreement the united states can still penalize iran for behavior such as its development of ballistic missiles or support for terrorism but it cannot simply reapply the same sanctions that were lifted under a different guise iran has the right to appeal to a joint committee and make the argument that the united states is in violation european officials have long argued that the agreement was intended only to restrict iran s nuclear program not the panoply of other issues if the international community were to do more to confront tehran over its efforts to destabilize neighbors in the middle east european officials have said it would be better to face an iran without nuclear weapons they have shown little enthusiasm for revisiting the deal much less undercutting it that mr trump s actions will satisfy conservatives who have been urging him to rip up the iran deal seemed unlikely in a column in the hill a capitol hill newspaper john r bolton a former ambassador to the united

a gathering of the council on foreign relations on monday that he has yet to talk with mr tillerson unlike his frequent conversations with former secretary of state john kerry with whom he negotiated the nuclear accord in an interview on monday with jacob heilbrunn editor of the national interest a foreign policy journal mr zarif raised the prospect that iran would be the one to back out if it comes to a major violation or what in the terms of the nuclear deal is called significant nonperformance then iran has other options available including withdrawing from the deal he said that would be an outcome welcomed by the trump administration top officials like mr tillerson and mr mattis have expressed concern about the effect on american relations with european allies if mr trump were to unilaterally pull out especially after he already announced his intention to back out of the paris climate change accord that europeans strongly support but some advisers to the president argue that if they can provoke iran into being the one to scrap the nuclear deal it will leave the united states in a stronger position mr trump has aligned the united states with sunni arab states like saudi arabia as well as israel in their mutual struggle with shiiteled iran over control of the middle east his administration has already announced modest new sanctions against iran but nothing on the scale of those imposed before the nuclear agreement

the effort by senate republican leaders to remake the nation s health care system which went well beyond the perimeters of mr obama s health care law was in retrospect doomed from the moment it began even with the wind of an unlikely win in the house at their backs photo the senate measure would impose annual caps on medicaid spending ending what has been an openended entitlement for the poor and disabled the process bypassed committees any public airing of the bill or formal bill drafting instead senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader farmed out the remaking of 17 percent of the economy to a small group of senators all republican white men the bad first look did not fade but under fire for the allmale panel mr mcconnell reduced it to little more than a kaffeeklatsch open to anyone who wanted to come by and chat health care republican senators reflecting the divide in the party quickly formed two camps those who wanted to squeeze hundreds of billions of dollars out of medicaid and those mainly from states that had expanded the program who wanted to preserve it both groups held constant meetings with many usually conservative senators like jerry moran of kansas and charles e grassley of iowa sliding into the moderate group s gatherings to quietly voice their own concerns senator rob portman of ohio in particular formed the spine of opposition to the bill and pushed for changes to reduce the cuts to medicaid in his state more than 700000 lowincome people have gained coverage through the expansion of medicaid under the affordable care act senator susan collins of maine criticized the trump administration s often specious descriptions of what the bill would actually do bolstering other more quiet critics resolve the only change that obamacare made in medicaid was to give states the option of expanding coverage with increased federal funding said ms collins who opposed the senate legislation yet the senate bill would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars from this program imposed an entirely new formula and reduced the reimbursement rate below the cost of medical inflation advertisement continue reading the main story the changes she added

meantime did not have enough reliable allies on the right mr paul made it clear from the start that he would not support anything but a full repeal of the law senators mike lee of utah and ted cruz of texas had repeated conversations with republican leaders and the white house about how to make the bill sufficiently conservative senator dean heller republican of nevada dealt an early blow by suggesting he would not support the bill making matters worse for the white house the bill had virtually no support from health care insurance patient advocate and disease groups and was harshly judged by the congressional budget office grassroots opposition to the bill aided by democrats like senator chuck schumer of new york swayed members of congress in a way rarely seen on capitol hill at

with the group of republican senators at the white house not one of whom was on the fence about the bill mr moran and mr lee two senators who were on the fence issued statements saying they would not support it a catastrophe for the white house photo late monday mr mcconnell responded by vowing to pass a measure to repeal the affordable care act now then work on a replacement over the next two years but on tuesday three republican senators ms collins shelley moore capito of west virginia and lisa murkowski of alaska told mr mcconnell they would not support his lastditch effort advertisement continue reading the main story ms capito has generally been an ally of republican leaders on even really tough votes and once told colleagues that the nearly 180000 people on medicaid in her state outnumbered the total number of people who had voted for her on tuesday in kansas citizenactivists like courtney eiterich 42 of lenexa who has multiple sclerosis were celebrating outside mr moran s office in olathe i ve never done this level of political activism before said ms eiterich who had been dogging mr moran for months but if i m not speaking out who s going to do it mr kasich who had been against the bill was pleased with the outcome on tuesday and recalled conversations he had with mr portman i told him all the time this is not just about opiates though opiates are a big part of it mr kasich said it s also about people who suffer mental illness or chronic illness rob was trying to figure out how to be constructive but at the same time he didn t want to be taken for granted in terms of his vote patient advocates who had major concerns about the bill were relieved we joined together in january over a plate of breakfast burritos so we call ourselves the burrito coalition said sue nelson a vice president of the american heart association we wrote letters we brought in patients we talked to congressional staff until we were blue in the face we provided members of congress with hundreds and thousands of stories from patients to let them know how critical it was to preserve affordable health care for their constituents now what mr trump once described as an easy process appears destined to stall his policy agenda and has damaged his diminished standing on capitol hill still the white house is not giving up late on tuesday sean spicer the white house press secretary announced that mr trump was inviting all republican senators to the white house on wednesday to talk about health care

some have answered by withdrawing their support the only black republican in the senate tim scott of south carolina criticized mr trump by telling vice news that his moral authority is compromised some black conservatives prominent and notsoprominent are weighing whether to leave the party altogether because they fear that under mr trump s leadership republicans may be complicit in espousing racism even after the ouster of stephen k bannon who as the president s chief strategist was accused of pushing white nationalist views into the west wing they say that mr trump has to reckon with his response to the violence and his history of taking controversial racial stances if he wants absolution they say he needs to show contrition many black republicans and their families have personally experienced racism and in some cases witnessed violence perpetrated by the ku klux klan and other supremacist groups that lynched thousands of people beat and murdered civil rights marchers and supported segregationist policies that held africanamericans back black conservatives balked at mr trump s lament that it was sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments as an uncompromising defense of confederate memorials and they fretted that he and his administration have made law and order a centerpiece of their response to charlottesville the tough on crime phrase in my mind is nothing more than a code phrase for imprisoning blacks and people of color mr cheadle said before criticizing mr trump for hiring only a handful of black people in the west wing mr trump waxes eloquent about providing jobs as the panacea for the racial divide and curing the woes of the inner city the president would do well to lead by example the majority of black republicans interviewed said they would continue to support the president even as they criticize him most said they hope that mr trump will prove his critics wrong and usher in a new phase of conservative policies that will overhaul the tax code create new jobs transform the health system and revamp the country s entitlement programs advertisement continue reading the main story several polls show that the majority of republicans agreed with mr trump s response despite the intense backlash he received and some africanamericans are in that camp i don t know that you can designate everybody who went to the rally from the camp of kkk as being nasty mean or say that their intention is to physically assault people said chuck linton 70 a retired military veteran from baltimore and an africanamerican i know that a lot of them their intention is to be violent but i don t think all of them are the white supremacists and the left wing and the

caldwell said he could not sleep the night of the raucous news conference when the president adamantly defended his blame on both sides position he wept the next day on fox news i knew after the news conference that he was going to want to see some positive coverage probably some black folks in front of the screen saying really nice things about how he is awesome and he rocked that news conference mr caldwell said of mr trump and i certainly wasn t going to be used as a puppet mr caldwell added that it was hard to defend president trump when you know that no matter what happens in some days or weeks he is going to step on the message and say something ridiculous and change the conversation going forward he said if there is a position that i can agree with him on i will but it is going to be with a much more critical viewpoint then there was before his position echoed mr scott who followed his vice interview by saying on cbs s face the nation that the president could regain his moral authority by sitting down with folks who have a personal experience a deep connection to the horror and the pain of this country s provocative racial history advertisement continue reading the main story quardricos driskell a republican federal lobbyist and a religion and politics professor at george washington university never supported the president and said he believed early in the campaign that mr trump held discriminatory views the moral dilemma i face at this very moment and the question i have to wrestle with is trump being the head of the republican party and yet courting and being complicit with this very small group that has always been at the fringes of our society said mr driskell who remains a republican he has now helped to usher them into the mainstream what does that mean as a black man who happens to be a republican and happens to believe in conservative values and principles liberal activists say black republicans have been ignoring mr trump s long history of racially offensive behavior mr trump settled a justice department suit that charged the family business with housing discrimination and falsely accused the nation s first black president of being born in kenya we are in the predicament that we are in now because of the fact that people did not read the writing on the wall said tamika d mallory a gun control activist and a chairwoman of the women s

advertisement trump says he has signed more bills than any president ever he hasn t image president trump signed two bills into law during a ceremony in the diplomatic reception room last month credit al dragothe new york times washington to hear president trump tell it his first six months in the white house should be judged in part by the legislation he has signed into law at rallies in speeches and on twitter mr trump repeatedly boasts of the bills he has signed 42 as of this week he has said no president has passed more legislation conceding once earlier this year that he trails franklin d roosevelt who he notes had a major depression to handle on monday he went even further claiming to have bested all of his predecessors in turning bills into law we ve signed more bills and i m talking about through the legislature than any president ever mr trump said at a made in america event at the white house for a while harry truman had us and now i think we have everybody turning to vice president mike pence he added an aside about news media factcheckers i better say think otherwise they will give you a pinocchio and i don t like pinocchios in fact as he approaches six months in office on thursday mr trump is slightly behind the lawmaking pace for the past six presidents who as a group signed an average of 43 bills during the same period and an analysis of the bills mr trump signed shows that about half were minor and inconsequential passed by congress with little debate among recent presidents both the total number of bills he signed and the legislation s substance make mr trump about average president jimmy carter signed 70 bills in the first six months according to an analysis of bills signed by previous white house occupants bill clinton signed 50 george w bush signed 20 bills into law barack obama signed 39 bills during the period including an 800 billion stimulus program to confront an economic disaster legislation to make it easier for women to sue for equal pay a bill to give the food and drug administration the authority to regulate tobacco and an expansion of the federal health insurance program for children mr truman and franklin delano roosevelt both had signed more bills into law by their 100day mark than mr trump did in almost twice that time truman had signed 55 bills and roosevelt had signed 76 during their first 100 days mr trump has signed several significant bills many in the works on capitol hill since well before he arrived in the oval office as is often the case for new presidents mr trump s allies point to a bill he signed to improve accountability and overhaul services at the scandalplagued veterans affairs department they note that the president signed into law spending plans that will significantly raise federal expenditures on the military and border security and they say mr trump and the republicanled congress worked to methodically reduce the burden of government regulation that effort to undo regulation involved 15 new laws which were the result of an aggressive push to employ a littleused legislative tool to roll back government rules put in place by former president barack obama those new laws could result in a significant shift in the way government regulates employee benefits worker safety the environment public lands and education these repeal bills are now law which means those obama regulations have been struck from the books forever house speaker paul d ryan said recently and legislation is not the only tool presidents can wield to enact their agendas his aides note that mr trump has used executive orders such as his ban on travel to the united states for refugees and those living in some muslim countries to get around what they say is unprecedented obstruction by democrats and he successfully won confirmation of neil m gorsuch to the supreme court but almost half the other bills mr trump has signed into law are ceremonial or routine the president includes in his count laws like the one to rename the federal courthouse in nashville after fred thompson the actor and former senator who died in 2015 even the republican leadership in the senate does not count those kinds of bills when they tally their legislative achievements by contrast mr trump s tally includes three laws to appoint members to the smithsonian board of regents another to seek research into better weather reports and one to require the department of homeland security to manage its fleet of vehicles more efficiently marc short the president s top legislative adviser acknowledged that no one would try to claim that renaming a building should be considered landmark legislation but he defended the president s repeated promotion of the bills he has signed into law it s a response to a lot of media coverage that has tried to downplay what he s accomplished mr short said there s an overarching coverage about what s not been accomplished the president is trying to point out what we actually have done mr trump has signed two budget bills that would be required of any president he signed a law largely endorsing the budget for nasa that mr obama had laid out and mr trump temporarily extended mr obama s program that gives veterans a choice of seeing a private doctor in certain cases the president complains that he has not gotten the news coverage he deserves for his legislative achievements though his bill signings are often aired live on television and his push to reverse regulations has been widely covered mr trump may yet assemble a more farreaching legislative record getting comprehensive legislation through congress and to the president s desk takes time even when the president s party controls both chambers of congress by the end of his tenure mr bush had signed major tax cuts expanded surveillance with the patriot act authorized votes to wage war overhauled federal education laws established freetrade deals and expanded medicare to include prescription drugs mr obama eventually passed the affordable care act and imposed new rules on financial services firms roosevelt created the federal deposit insurance corporation and the tennessee valley authority enacted social security and started public works projects in response to the great depression and began farm subsidies since mr trump took office the house has passed a health care overhaul and republicans have talked about a major infrastructure bill and an overhaul of taxes but for him to compile major legislative achievements will take time said david r mayhew a professor of political science at yale who tracks the legislative achievements of american presidents generally speaking congress needs many months to do something big he said here is a rundown of the 42 bills mr trump has signed into law veterans bills mr trump frequently points to his work on behalf of veterans who supported him by almost two to one over hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election as evidence of his legislative success at a recent rally on behalf of military families mr trump bragged that he had signed legislation that went through the house went through the senate and i signed it really fast that law was the veterans affairs accountability and whistleblower protection act which will allow officials to remove bad employees and promote whistleblowing passed in response to a scandal over manipulating patient wait times the new law puts in place longsought changes to overhaul management of the department and improve health care and benefits for veterans image sean spicer center the white house press secretary listened as mr trump spoke during a signing event for the veterans affairs accountability and whistleblower protection act bill last month credit al drago for the new york times john hoellwarth the national communications director for amvets called the new law a positive step but said it was a small part of overall improvements at the department that had been put in place slowly for years a lot of the things that are moving the department of veterans affairs in the right direction actually got underway before the trump administration mr hoellwarth said noting that mr trump had appointed a former obama administration official to be his secretary of veterans affairs another bill that mr trump signed extended an obamaera program that allows some veterans to see private doctors and streamlined the way their deductibles and copays get processed the law is essentially an accounting maneuver intended to give lawmakers more time to debate more substantive changes a third new law allows community policing grants to be used to hire and train veterans to be officers reversal of obama regulations since becoming law in 1996 the congressional review act has allowed presidents to use legislation to roll back his predecessor s regulations but until mr trump took office that power had been used only once by mr bush who reversed a rule on workplace injuries working with the republicancontrolled congress mr trump has used it 15 times to unravel what he said were overly burdensome regulations imposed on americans and businesses senate joint resolution 34 eliminated a rule by the federal communications commission that would have prohibited internet providers from collecting sharing or selling consumers information without their permission another house joint resolution 38 nullified a regulation that would have required coal companies to make sure that waste from mountaintop mining was not polluting local waterways image a mountaintop removal coal mining operation in wise county va in april 2012 credit mario tamagetty images collectively the 15 regulatory laws may represent the president s broadest legislative impact though they are less about doing things and more about undoing them signing the bills into law allowed the president with the flick of a pen to erase rules on the environment labor financial protections internet privacy abortion education and gun rights that s saving about 18 billion a year in compliance costs mr short said including the impact of the president s executive orders that seek to reverse regulations we think they are a huge part of the economic success of the first six months but mr trump can no longer use the tool the review act gives presidents and lawmakers 60 legislative days to rapidly roll back major regulations put in place by a previous administration that deadline has passed if mr trump and republican lawmakers want to overturn any more obamaera regulations they will have to do it through the normal lawmaking or regulatory processes which can take years space and science new presidents often use their first months in office to sign noncontroversial legislation that has broad bipartisan support four of the laws mr trump cites as evidence of his success involved nasa or science and generated little opposition mr trump signed legislation that approved nearly 20 billion in spending for nasa keeping its financing level almost unchanged from mr obama s budget the budget would allow nasa to pursue sending humans to mars during the next two decades and would continue work on rockets that have long been in development a separate law calls for research on improving weather reports though it provides no additional funds for the effort the weather research and forecasting innovation act of 2017 requires the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to prioritize weather data modeling computing forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy finally two laws are aimed at encouraging women to participate more fully in scientific endeavors the inspire women act inspiring the next space pioneers innovators researchers and explorers women act requires the nasa administrator to encourage women and girls to study science technology engineering and mathematics pursue careers in aerospace the promoting women in entrepreneurship act seeks to encourage the creation of entrepreneurial programs to recruit women for science math and technical careers bureaucratic tweaks as a candidate mr trump vowed to wage an allout assault on the federal bureaucracy stephen k bannon the president s senior strategist has promised a daily fight for the deconstruction of the administrative state but mr trump s legislative assault has moved slowly the four bills designed to improve government functions that he has signed into law since taking office have made only small tweaks one law called the gao access and oversight act of 2017 gives the government accountability office more power to compel other agencies to provide information during its investigations the follow the rules act clarifies existing whistleblower laws to make it clear that protections apply to employees who refuse a superior s orders to break an existing rule or regulation image an uber

new york times the modernizing government travel act would give government employees the right to seek reimbursement for official travel by uber lyft or other ridehailing companies previously the government would not reimburse such expenses and the stop asset and vehicle excess act the save act is a response to a 2015 inspector general s finding that the department of homeland security was wasting money by mismanaging its vehicle fleet the latest bill signed by mr trump the securing our agriculture and food act directs the secretary of homeland security to take steps to safeguard america s food system against terrorism and makes a few other tweaks ceremonial and routine lawmaking in addition to signing two budget bills mr trump signed a bill to improve processing of pension benefits for police officers and he signed a dozen routine or ceremonial bills that attracted little attention one law called the us wants to compete for a world expo act declares that the sense of

here are five reasons the danger may not be as scary as you ve heard the united states has been issuing vague threats against north korea for more than 15 years the george w bush and barack obama administrations both threatened war setting red lines that pyongyang almost always went on to cross mr bush even declared north korea to be one third of the axis of evil along with iraq which the united states military invaded the next year north korean leaders correctly assessed those threats as empty never sending the countries careening into an unintended war and the threats didn t seem to affect american credibility it s not clear that mr trump by upgrading the adjectives in his own threats changes much americans might have strong views about what makes mr trump different from his predecessors but in pyongyang where the nuances of american politics and personalities are less familiar those distinctions are likely less frontofmind words matter in international relations but actions matter far more current american action or lack thereof sends a message of calm and caution rather than fire and fury states have a hard time reading one another s internal politics so they tend to rely heavily on reading one another s actions for clues as to their intentions and american action toward north korea remains unchanged american troops in nearby guam and japan are still in their barracks naval warships are holding a respectful distance these are the sorts of signals not a leader s offhand comments that matter most in international relations washington is sending a clear consistent message to pyongyang that the united states still wants to avoid escalation video though north korea has returned mr trump s threat with its own against guam the country s actions suggest it is only for show advertisement continue reading the main story no one has an incentive to escalate and all sides understand this wars can happen when states conclude rightly or wrongly that the other side might see conflict is in its interests this can lead them to prepare for war making it likelier that an accident or miscalculation could send them stumbling into one but that is not the case now north korea s interests are to avoid a conflict it would likely lose the united states interests are to avoid a conflict that would risk a nuclear attack against an american city that clarity is stabilizing despite longstanding speculation about mr kim s mental fitness scholars agree he has repeatedly proven himself rational and focused on his government s survival his country s weapons programs are designed to deter a war not start one and while mr trump s comment hint at an appetite for war the institutions that carry out american foreign policy particularly the military have behaved conservatively giving the world ample reason to dismiss his statement states tend to ignore unclear isolated signals like mr trump s some analysts worry that mr trump could inject more uncertainty into an already tense situation the president s most bellicose statements appear to contradict his own administration s more measured lines on north korea but studies on foreign policy

and forcing a state like north korea to change its assessment of american intentions would require more than a few words states also tend to disregard any signal they perceive as unclear or ambiguous if americans can t agree on what mr trump meant you can bet the analysts in pyongyang are no more certain any risk to american credibility or of trapping mr trump in a dangerous position is easy to overstate extensive research suggests that empty threats neither damage a state s global credibility nor create pressures forcing it to follow through on those threats though questions of credibility are still debated by political scientists history is littered with examples of false threats conveniently ignored during the cold war the soviet premier nikita khrushchev repeatedly threatened to seize west berlin but soviet actions betrayed his threats as empty allowing washington and moscow to quietly sidestep the risk of war in germany he never felt politically forced to invade and few doubted soviet credibility a few months later when moscow tried to install nuclear weapons in cuba an action that spoke louder and more clearly than any of khrushchev s words that is the real lesson of the cuban missile crisis if mr trump moves thousands of troops from guam to south korea you can worry that would send a clear and destabilizing signal of american intentions against north korea but

kushner and the president blithely straddle irreconcilable contradictions to get what they want but in kushner s case in ivanka trump s too that has been an especially perverse spectacle he and she are the prince and princess of having it both ways they expect our gratitude for their supposed and only occasionally successful efforts to tame trump but they re also the ones who worked so mightily to put him in a position where untamed he can do such damage it s as if they deliberately shattered a glass grabbed a broom and then solicited applause for their sweeping advertisement continue reading the main story they cover for the president still smack in the middle of his cockamamie interview with the times last week ivanka dropped by the oval office so that her daughter arabella could give grandpa a kiss how precious how humanizing how entirely choreographed grandpa spent the duration of his campaign mocking the establishment swells who migrate to enclaves like davos switzerland and sun valley idaho for highaltitude highfalutin conferences on the conundrums of modern life that didn t stop kushner and ivanka from joining those very swells in sun valley a week and a half ago for precisely such a symposiumontheslopes i m told that their presence had a dampening effect on formal panels and informal conversations how do you take issue with trump when there s family listening in and that a few glares came their way i wonder if they even noticed they re outsiders when that s politically advantageous insiders as soon as the canap√©s come around not long before sun valley they swanned up to the hamptons for a party at the home of the washington post poohbah lally weymouth there in one of the global elite s premier beachheads they chatted radiantly with democrats whom trump demonizes and members of the news media which trump has cast as an enemy of the american people it s an elaborate moral jujitsu they perform there s one constant their selfadvancement and selfpreservation but kushner may be overplaying his hand his counsel to trump has been flawed to say the least he reportedly lobbied for the firing of james comey which didn t turn out so well maybe the hiring of anthony scaramucci as the new white house communications director a move blessed by kushner over the objections of reince priebus the chief of staff will prove wiser i have my doubts cast as one of the president s most dependable assets kushner could in fact be a significant liability someone whose escapades by turns grabby and cavalier give investigators and detractors a whole extra sandbox of improprieties to rummage through i hear that he feels persecuted wronged in that regard too he s like his fatherinlaw though trump wears his selfpity fury and ruthlessness right out front for the whole world to see kushner puts a pale mask of calm and courteousness over his maybe the senators who question him on monday will pry it off maybe they ll actually bring some color to his face we won t be able to witness what happens but we ll find out

photo on some emotional level one might be able to see why donald trump threatened to unleash fire and fury against north korea if it endangered the united states the north s nuclear program is a growing menace its warmongering tirades are unquestionably unnerving and peaceful solutions to the threat it poses have been maddeningly elusive over many years and many american administrations but mr trump is president of the united states and if prudent disciplined leadership was ever required it is now rhetorically stomping his feet as he did on tuesday is not just irresponsible it is dangerous he is no longer a businessman trying to browbeat someone into a deal he commands the most powerful nuclear and conventional arsenal in the world and any miscalculation could be catastrophic even if mr trump s provocative remarks were part of a deliberate strategy for ratcheting up pressure on north korea and on china which as the north s main food and fuel supplier has more influence on it than any other nation they would be at odds with the measured approach of his predecessors this is a president with no prior government or military experience who has shown no clear grasp of complex strategic issues as the times reported wednesday his inflammatory words were entirely improvised and took his closest associates by surprise intentionally or not they echoed president harry truman s 1945 pledge to inflict a rain of ruin from the air if japan did not surrender after the first atomic bomb was dropped at hiroshima which made them seem even more ominous newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the opinion today newsletter every weekday get thoughtprovoking commentary from oped columnists the times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york timess products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters mr trump and his aides must have anticipated that he would be asked by reporters about north korea after the united nations security council tightened sanctions on saturday after the north s latest missile tests why then didn t his team of generals john kelly the new chief of staff lt gen h r mcmaster the national security adviser and jim mattis the defense secretary who know well the perils of war caution him about the role of nuclear weapons in national security strategy about better ways to signal toughness and about the dangers of idle threats

the taliban has long been willing to talk to the united states but has resisted sitting down with the afghan government which it regards as a puppet regime the afghan government has been willing to talk to the taliban but wants to ensure its legitimacy is not eroded the united states has worked only in fits and starts to build a format for talks and preliminary understandings to get substantive negotiations going america s primary focus on the war has contributed to an inconsistent peace effort for all parties to the afghan conflict building and sustaining commitment from leaders and support from broader constituencies for pursuing peace has been much harder than continuing the war each side wants to negotiate from a position of strength skepticism about the enemy s willingness to negotiate has gotten in the way of willingness to test probe and risk looking too eager a surge of united states commitment to negotiating a political settlement would not remove all the obstacles but it is a prerequisite a first step in this direction could be for president trump to declare publicly his intent to make a peace deal he could show his readiness to work out the details of a military withdrawal and emphasize the protection of united states national security interests in negotiations newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york timess products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters a strong and seasoned diplomatic team would be needed to carry out the president s commitment unless negotiating peace is someone s fulltime job there can t be adequate diplomatic vigor he could support the appointment of an experienced and respected neutral mediator neither american nor afghan who could seek to generate and sustain momentum for a peace process that will inevitably be buffeted by spikes in violence and wavering political attention spans in afghanistan unexceptionally there are vested interests on all sides in continuing the war because of the resources conflict attracts antipathies toward sharing power and the difficulty of justifying compromise with an enemy against the backdrop of human losses and entrenched narratives the united states can surmount these hurdles by influencing the taliban s calculations through applying military pressure and offering political opportunity and using our leverage with the afghan political elite to ensure their commitment to negotiating the taliban is violently opposed to the united states military presence on afghan soil but does not have aspirations beyond afghanistan a peace deal could allow the united states to focus its resources on threats from the region that are directed toward the homeland and core american interests pursuing peace is also the most effective way of managing the region s hedgers and spoilers there is a consensus among iran russia and pakistan as well as the more constructively minded chinese for a political settlement views on desirable terms no doubt differ but this consensus is an opportunity for the united states pakistan is the most problematic of the regional powers as it continues offering sanctuary to the taliban pakistan wants a political arrangement in afghanistan to be hospitable to its interests and inhospitable to indian interests but pakistan would be inclined to support a political settlement that takes seriously its perception of its interests in its own neighborhood advertisement continue reading the main story a peace deal won t happen quickly or easily unless it becomes a dominant focus of united states policy it won t happen at all if the trump administration neglects a push for peace american leaders could find themselves faced with the same choices as now or worse when the next strategy review comes around

on aug 15 mr cohn stood nearby in the lobby of trump tower where the president told reporters there also were very fine people on both sides of the charlottesville rally after mr trump left mr cohn stood uncomfortably fielding questions about the president s statements and he repeatedly declined to comment he debated for over a week with his wife and friends on whether to quit according to the people familiar with his thinking this week mr cohn decided to remain in his job believing he could be more effective as a public servant inside the white house than out of it he is one of the few jewish members in the administration who have publicly condemned mr trump s remarks about charlottesville although he has quietly disagreed with the president on a number of policy matters as mr trump stood by his equivocal comments on charlottesville and business leaders left presidential advisory panels in protest mr cohn told the financial times he felt enormous pressure to step down various friends and mr cohn s wife were at one point among those who were urging him to resign said several people familiar with their advice a senior administration official said the president was not surprised by mr cohn s remarks to the financial times another official said the sentiments had been relayed clearly to mr trump and mr cohn had said that if asked he would say how he felt but on friday roger stone a longtime adviser to mr trump tweeted that mr cohn should be fired immediately for his public attack on the president in his tweet mr stone misspelled the name of mr cohn whom he has aggressively criticized and said the economic adviser was recommended for his white house job by jared kushner it is highly unusual for a senior member of any presidential administration to publicly discuss the possibility of stepping down geoff garin a veteran democratic pollster who worked on hillary clinton s 2008 presidential campaign said even though mr cohn did not criticize mr

the financial times that as a jewish american i will not allow neonazis ranting jews will not replace us to cause this jew to leave his job but the job has not been easy for mr cohn said two people familiar with his thinking every day at the white house requires a different calculus over how best to spend his political capital right now these people said he will focus on economic policies that he believes are essential to the stability of the markets and the united states work force even when other issues worry him nudging mr trump toward a more freetrade stance that avoids harsh steps toward china and other economic partners is paramount these people said part of that they added is opposing tariffs on steel aluminum and other goods that might damage relationships with american allies but using political capital on those fights means avoiding others even when the president espouses policies that run contrary to mr cohn s own principles the two people said among other things they said mr cohn disagrees with the president s directive banning transgender people from joining the military but will leave that fight to others on aug 17 with word of mr cohn s unhappiness

president at his golf club in bedminster nj mr cohn relayed his concerns about mr trump s comments on charlottesville said people with knowledge of the gathering the exact details of the talk are not clear but the president urged mr cohn to stay i have had numerous private conversations with the president on this topic mr cohn told the financial times adding that i have not been bashful saying what i think one possible part of mr cohn s calculus is the chance that he could be named federal reserve chairman early next year a move mr trump has said he is considering mr cohn has in the past expressed interest in the job said two people close to him but unlike past fed chairmen mr cohn is not an economist and some of his friends have said it is hard to imagine him in the more reserved less dynamic environment of the fed which would be a huge contrast to the pace of goldman sachs or the white house steven mnuchin the treasury secretary who also is jewish defended mr trump in a statement a week ago after more than 300 of his yale classmates urged him in a letter to step down at a briefing with reporters at the white house on friday mr mnuchin an old business partner of mr

it was far from clear that tuesday s efforts by the scouts would calm an uproar that began even before mr trump concluded his address on monday night although scouting offices and social media accounts were besieged with messages condemning the president s appearance others celebrated mr trump s speech in west virginia trump gave a great speech to the boy scouts and they chanted back we

minted eagle scouts there were also plenty of people in that audience who did not agree with what he said and there were probably plenty of people whether they agreed with him or not who felt it was an inappropriate venue to discuss politics in the opening moments of his appearance it seemed that mr trump who was not a boy scout as a youth would mostly avoid talking about the partisan clashes that have riven washington but mr trump the 19th occupant of the white house to also serve as the honorary president of the boy scouts of america ultimately speckled his remarks with political speech

of his opponent s name he resurfaced his grievances with fake news and repeatedly doubted that the news media would report the size of the jamboree crowd and when he landed on the second point of the scout law loyalty mr trump interrupted himself to say we could use some more loyalty i will tell you that more than a dozen current republican officeholders who were scouts declined to comment or did not respond to messages on tuesday but a spokeswoman for interior secretary ryan zinke who also attended the jamboree said that he thought the speech was very well received and that he appreciated the president taking the time to talk with america s future leaders senator luther strange republican of alabama and an eagle scout said in a statement president donald trump was absolutely right when he said that the united states has no better citizens than its boy scouts and it s wonderful that he has appointed so many eagle scouts to cabinet level positions but the president s tone and message alarmed many other people with ties to the scouts alison deshotels whose 11yearold son cole has been in a cub scout pack in louisiana said her son had been wary about continuing with the organization even though he had enjoyed camping and pinewood derby races but after watching the president s speech he said he did not want to remain involved i didn t really agree with anything he was saying cole said in an interview and everyone in the boy scouts was cheering advertisement continue reading the main story gerald r ford is the only president to have earned the eagle rank but presidents from both parties have been close to the scouts their signatures have been affixed to eagle scout certificates they have hosted boys and leaders in the oval office and many have appeared at jamborees when you re in a position to touch a young person and at least create some kind of spark that may lead them to a career in public life don t get distracted with your other stuff said michael dukakis an eagle scout who was governor of massachusetts and the 1988 democratic nominee for president the controversy that followed mr trump s appearance presented another challenge to the scouts who have faced frustration and anger in recent decades for policies on gay and transgender people although the scouts have rolled back many of their most controversial rules they said this year that they would allow transgender members the group has still struggled to cultivate cultural relevance the scouts american affiliate said this year that it had more than 23 million youth participants down from nearly 46 million in the late 1990s the scouts have also faced separate criticism and litigation for the group s handling of sexual misconduct which is documented in files that the organization has held closely amid the fallout from mr trump s speech which also included an anecdote about an encounter with a new york developer at a cocktail party some said the scouts were not at fault the boy scouts were not in the wrong here said zach wahls a cofounder of scouts for equality which pressured for changes to membership policies we should not be blaming the organization that always invites the president to speak we should be talking about the president who took that opportunity and twisted it

president trump along with roundly questioning climate change has moved quickly to wipe out those measures with the support of coal companies and other commercial interests separately mr trump s interior department is drawing up plans to reduce wilderness and historic areas that are now protected as national monuments creating even more opportunities for profit richard reavey the head of government relations for cloud peak energy which operates a strip mine here that sends coal to the midwest and increasingly to coalburning power plants in asia said mr trump s change of course was meant to correct wrongs of the past the obama administration he said had become intent on killing the coal industry and had used federal lands as a cudgel to restrict exports the only avenues of growth currently given the shutdown of so many coalburning power plants in the united states are markets overseas their goal in collusion with the environmentalists was to drive us out of the export business mr reavey said even with the moves so far the prospect of coal companies operating in a big way on federal land and for any major job growth is dim in part because environmentalists have blocked construction of a coal export terminal and there is limited capacity at the port the companies use in vancouver competition from other global suppliers offering coal to asian power plants is also intense but at least for now coal production and exports are rising in the powder river basin after a major decline last year western coal the majority of united states coal is produced in the west with a small share of it then exported about 85 percent of coal extracted from federal lands comes from the powder river basin in wyoming and montana the trump administration is rolling back an

challenging the repeal of a yearold moratorium on federal coal leasing advertisement continue reading the main story if we hand over control of these lands to a narrow range of special interests we lose an iconic part of the country and the west s identity said chris saeger executive director of the montanabased environmental group western values project referring to coal mining and oil and gas drilling that the interior department is moving to rapidly expand mr trump s point man is ryan zinke a native montanan who rode a horse to work on his first day as head of the interior department a former member of the navy seals and republican congressman mr zinke oversees the national park system as well as the bureau of land management which controls 250 million acres nationwide parts of which are used to produce oil gas coal lumber and hay in late june mr zinke visited whitefish mont to attend a meeting of western governors where he vowed to find a balance between extracting commodities from federal lands and protecting them photo our greatest treasures are public lands mr zinke said in a speech it is not a partisan issue it is an american issue afterward protesters from the sierra club and other groups held a rally in the town square against the actions taken by mr zinke during his first months on the job chanting shame and liar and carrying signs opposing his policies but mr zinke was not in public view just before the rally started he was inside a nearby building meeting with bill cadman a vice president of whiting petroleum a company that drills on federal lands until recently a state legislator in colorado mr cadman has lobbied the interior department to repeal a rule that limits methane emissions from oil and gas sites on federal land as he left the brief gathering mr cadman said he was only catching up with mr zinke whom he has known for decades on familyrelated matters he also acknowledged that mr zinke wielded a lot of power over the energy industry advertisement continue reading the main story we are all affected by this constant regulatory quagmire mr cadman said seeing a liberal attack cloud peak energy had been preparing for several years to seize upon the arrival of an industryfriendly administration in washington but it was also prepared to fight without one at a gathering of a coal industry trade group in 2015 mr reavey the company s chief lobbyist left no doubts about the company s determination to defend mining in the powder river basin which includes operations here in decker mr reavey likened the industry s existential crisis to that of tobacco companies in the 1990s the coal industry he told executives had been targeted by a liberal conspiracy of environmental groups news organizations and regulators coal would suffer the same fate as cigarettes he warned unless the industry stood its ground photo he showed a powerpoint slide that outlined the strategy of the industry s opponents they sought to diminish coal s social acceptability the slide showed while also cutting profits through massive increase in regulation and reduced demandmarket access he equated the situation to a scene in the film independence day in which the american president asks the alien invaders what is it you want us to do an alien replies die during president barack obama s second term the coal industry s chief antagonist was sally jewell a former oil industry engineer appointed interior secretary in 2013 ms jewell an avid hiker had also served as chief executive of the outdoor gear company rei she saw mining companies as a particular problem because they too often left behind polluted mine pits and paid too little for coal leases on federal land starting two years ago ms jewell took a series of steps to change the relationship between coal companies and the federal government she imposed a moratorium on new federal coal leases while beginning a threeyear study of the industry s environmental consequences more than 40 percent of all coal mined in the united states comes from federal land and when burned it generates roughly 10 percent of the country s total greenhouse gas emissions in addition she called for greater transparency in the awarding of coal leases and she backed an increase in the royalty payments made to operate coal mines on public lands advertisement continue reading the main story the corruption in the coal sector is just so rampant she said in an interview a central problem she said was the lack of competitive bidding for mining leases only 11 of the 107 sales of federal coal leases between 1990 and 2012 received more than one bid according to a report by the government accountability office a second study by a nonprofit think tank estimated that the practice had shortchanged taxpayers tens of billions of dollars another hotbutton issue was how much to charge in royalties which generate about 1 billion a year for the federal government under federal rules adopted in 1920 coal companies are required to pay not less than 125 percent on sales of surface coal mined on federal lands but for years studies indicate the companies paid far less as little as 25 percent of the ultimate sale price because they often negotiated large royalty discounts with sympathetic federal officials companies also often sell coal first to a corporate affiliate at a sharply reduced price before reselling it to the intended customer costing the government a chunk of its royalties according to the government accountability office study the technique was particularly popular among mines with foreign buyers

supporters of the president point to his emphatic stance against regulations that restrain businesses as well as the dozens of executive orders he has signed that try to roll them back according to my colleagues julie hirschfeld davis and michael d shear he has signed 13 bills to wipe out obamaera regulations using the congressional review act and ordered agency reviews of regulations across the government peter c kenny chief market strategist for global markets advisory group and independent market strategist at kenny company wrote on monday it appears as though the trump administration s focus on what it can control ie rolling back obamaera regulations is effectively beginning to bear results in the form of economic resurgence but that s not right listen to the earnings conference calls of the biggest publicly traded companies over the past several weeks which are the real reason the stock market has soared and virtually none of those phone calls attributed higher profits to reduced costs to comply with regulations the only time the word regulation was even used on apple s earnings call during which the company described how it beat analysts estimates by a wide margin was in reference to china the word did not get a mention on amazon s earnings call nor was there any reference to washington at all despite constant chatter about how antitrust policy should be applied to the retailing behemoth even on goldman sachs s earnings call which included several questions and answers related to regulations not once did any official suggest that the firm s earnings were a result of lighter regulatory burdens indeed the bank warned several times that it was too early and too difficult to predict exactly how deregulation efforts would affect its various businesses jamie dimon chief executive of jpmorgan chase famously was so upset on his conference call about the state of washington and the inability to get anything done he declared we have become one of the most bureaucratic confusing litigious societies on the planet newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york timess products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters of all america s various industries it is the wall street banks that should see the most benefit from deregulatory measures already prosecutors have sought less in fines from the banks than they did under the obama administration and mr trump has pledged to repeal or at least reform doddfrank the checks on the banking system imposed in the wake of the most recent financial crisis but that would require legislation the administration is at a minimum telling a onesided story it s a bit disingenuous charles campbell managing director at mkm partners said about mr trump and his team s taking credit for the rising stock market for the average american who is uninformed it probably passes as sounding correct he lamented advertisement continue reading the main story but mr campbell said it was a little early for companies to see direct benefits from deregulation efforts this is the first full reporting period quite honestly since mr trump took office he noted in industries like finance mr campbell said stocks are trading with the expectation that there will be businessfriendly changes in the regulatory environment it is the anticipation that there will be an effect he said it is very true that mr trump s deregulatory agenda should eventually make its way into the earnings reports of united states companies but to suggest that it has already happened is a stretch the larger issue is when it does happen how much can deregulation really help juice the economy the answer will not satisfy those who have been clamoring for a change in policy according to douglas holtzeakin a conservative economist who served in the george w bush administration and advised senator john mccain s 2008 presidential campaign deregulatory efforts will not do nearly as much as some people assume he contends that the obamaera regulatory explosion imposed a cumulative 890 billion in additional compliance costs on the private sector and he adds some have argued that getting rid of the regulations would raise gross domestic product by just exactly that 890 billion but here s the rub it isn t that simple in large part because a huge amount of that figure is a transfer in wealth to comply with the regulations mr holtzeakin estimates the real savings of deregulation are more like 225 billion if gradually achieved over 10 years that translates into an additional 01 percentage point in growth he writes while not exactly chump change it highlights the difficulty in substantially moving the longterm rate of economic growth

president dwight d eisenhower used to say that the more shrill the soviet leader nikita khrushchev was in the language he used against the united states promising we will bury you and we re turning out missiles like sausages the more tempered he would be mr beschloss said president john f kennedy was similarly restrained in his rhetoric in the runup to the cuban missile crisis which was prompted by the discovery that nuclear missile sites were being constructed by the soviet union in cuba mr beschloss said in an address on oct 22 1962 he called upon khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine reckless and provocative threat to world peace and to stable relations between our two nations and move the world back from the abyss of destruction as for the united states kennedy said the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing mr trump s statement delivered from his bedminster nj golf resort went far beyond the usual toughbutvague language that past presidents have used to confront north korea s frequent provocations their responses full of strong condemnations and recognition of grave threats have mostly left out the fiery nationalistic language favored by the north korean leader kim jongun and his father kim jongil before him mr trump s by contrast seemed to have adopted it this is a little bit more jingoistic and it borrows a little bit from the tone of the north koreans said peter feaver who helped shape president george w bush s message as an adviser on his national security council staff mr feaver now a political science professor at duke compared mr trump s choice of words to comments that mr bush made in 2003 about iraqi militants targeting american troops in iraq there are some who feel like that the conditions are such that they can attack us

democrat on the foreign relations committee said that mr trump s comments showed that he lacks the temperament and judgment to deal with the serious crisis the united states confronts we should not be engaging in the same kind of blustery and provocative statements as north korea about nuclear war mr cardin added mr trump is well known for using harsh language threats and taunts against adversaries when it comes to domestic matters often using his twitter feed as a weapon but he has mostly been more careful on the international front leaving his utterances about north korea vague though last month he ridiculed mr kim after one of his missile launches saying does this guy have anything better to do with his life victor cha a former national security council official who holds the korea chair at the center for strategic and international studies said the closest an american president had come to mr trump s bellicose language was when bill clinton declared in 1993 during a speech in the demilitarized zone between north and south korea that if pyongyang ever used nuclear weapons it would be the end of their country i take trump s statement in the same spirit mr cha said describing the president s comments not as the promise of an american attack but as a warning of the consequences if the north were to use a nuclear weapon or intercontinental ballistic missile it sounded mr cha said like a message of deterrence which is important now to avoid any miscalculation mr feaver said the explosive statement put mr trump on a risky path because of its potential to inflame mr kim but was in keeping with his penchant for upending the established protocols of diplomacy in efforts to bring about a better outcome they may be saying look we have a 30year record of bipartisan failure on this issue so let s flip the script and give north korea a bit of its own medicine and see if we can get a different result mr feaver said but breaking with tradition can have perilous consequences when bombs and missiles are involved if this was impulsive that would be very much out of the history of the presidency on matters like this mr beschloss said you don t have presidents blurting out things when lives are at stake and if that is what it was it would be scary

there are surely few worse ways of accomplishing this than demanding that they bend the knee which is more likely to breed resistance than assent convincing democrats to adopt a more radical politics is challenging enough without trying to insult and humiliate them into submission mr heer peers into the political realignment occurring on the left with a particular focus on what he brands the dirtbag left he looks at how breitbart mike cernovich and others on the far right were able to recalibrate the republican party but mr heer does not think the same dynamic would work on the other end

in the 1980s late night did not have an articulated political perspective and while its host expressed liberal leanings later in his career back then his ideological slant was as unclear as well that of mr trump what they also shared was a gift for stinging insults so perhaps it s no surprise that mr trump s gibes found a receptive audience mr trump earned applause criticizing the city s management the first of several times his political attacks resonated on mr letterman s talk shows listening to this stuff mr letterman said it seems to me you are dying to get to some public platform to superimpose those feelings upon the american awareness one decade and a few appearances later their conversation became chummier on late show mr letterman asked mr trump about the duty of the wealthy to give back could you give me an idea of something nice you ve done for someone recently mr letterman asked a setup to perhaps talk about charity instead mr trump referred to his exwife marla maples i married marla and now i m giving her a huge settlement say what you will about the etiquette or morality of this quip but for the purposes of latenight comedy it s hard to beat mr letterman chuckled even looking a bit jealous if i had said that people would have booed me he said after separating from ms maples mr trump who occasionally laughed on the show something he rarely does in public today offered to set mr letterman up with her i m going to wait and see how she makes out in the prenup the host said they bonded over being older fathers god forbid something happens to me would you take my son mr letterman asked and mr trump agreed that s called a great gene pool in mr letterman s final decade in late night when he leaned more on longform conversation than scripted comedy mr trump acted as a pundit hitting the same populist notes that became his campaign rhetoric i don t see greatness unless we do something about china and some others he said in 2010 adding that america should be sending businesspeople not diplomats to negotiate deals newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york timess products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters with mr trump mr letterman felt comfortable going long stretches without jokes probing his thoughts on the issue of the day and treating him with more respect than he did a sparring partner like bill o reilly mr letterman took shots at mr trump but they were typically about his hair the host treated their disagreements seriously pushing back for instance when mr trump praised coal instead of green energy i d rather see the windmills than the choking clouds of coal smoke mr letterman responded later when mr trump argued that a mosque shouldn t be built near ground zero mr letterman protested asking if we were at war with muslims mr trump s response was so glib that you could miss its extremism somebody knocked down the world trade center mr letterman stood firm here insisting the war is with terrorists not muslims mr trump conceded the point mr letterman and mr trump had such an amiable rapport that they could disagree heatedly without rancor no conversation illustrates their kinship better than mr trump s first appearance after mr letterman facing a blackmail threat confessed to having affairs with staff members on the show mr trump always expressed sympathy for whatever famous man was then battling scandal including mike tyson rod blagojevich and woody allen advertisement continue reading the main story here too mr trump celebrated the toughness of mr letterman s response the host pressed for an arrest saying he wished more people would take mr letterman s pugnacious approach in a deep deadpan voice full of anguish mr letterman who was privately in pain over the scandal responded to this support why don t you come home with me tonight don even though mr trump s political success owes a debt to popular culture no talk show not even mr fallon s is responsible for his rise and it s important to recall that until recently few thought him a plausible presidential candidate mr letterman has said he never did but what s striking about the episode where he called mr trump a racist is how seriously he took the comments about barack obama nobody should be amused mr letterman told another guest dr phil who made light of mr trump s embrace of the birther movement mr letterman wasn t having it it s all fun it s all a circus it s all a rodeo he said until it smacks of racism when mr trump was considered by many to be a diversion mr letterman approached mr trump s outrageous comments with moral gravity mr letterman not only went further than dr phil who said he didn t think mr trump was a racist but argued earlier than most that what mr trump was doing merited a serious response not just jokes and yet when mr trump dug in after being criticized for making a normshattering comment something he would go on to do many times mr letterman backed down on the same show where mr letterman apologized mr trump had barely sat down before noting it was the first day of sweeps you need me david he said earlier this year mr letterman said that he was wrong to say mr trump wasn t racist and when he declared last week that mr trump was on his wish list for an interview it sounded as if he might be looking for a second chance i have insight now that heretofore i did not have mr letterman told the hollywood reporter about mr trump adding later what we need now is somebody like myself to sit down with him and calmly get him to sign some papers and then have him leave the white house

photo london in his first solo trip to the broader middle east as president trump s designated peacemaker jared kushner has found both cause for optimism and reminders of just what a daunting task his fatherinlaw has given him over the course of two days he met with leaders from several influential arab countries and emerged encouraged by their stated eagerness to help him bring israelis and palestinians together but his visit on wednesday with president abdel fattah elsisi of egypt showed how other issues can easily complicate the initiative as both sides sought to paper over a dispute over american aid just a day earlier the united states cut or delayed nearly 300 million in aid to egypt a symbolic blow to a strategic relationship that has been a pillar of american policy in the middle east for almost four decades it was also a sign of growing impatience on the part of secretary of state rex w tillerson who does not share mr trump s affinity for mr sisi mr kushner was caught out by bad timing his trip to egypt had been fixed weeks earlier and officials said the aid decision was driven by schedules unrelated to his travels mr sisi and mr kushner gave no public hint of discord as they grinned and shook hands for the benefit of news photographers mr sisi s office later issued a lengthy statement praising relations between the two nations advertisement continue reading the main story mr tillerson tightened the purse strings to signal displeasure with mr sisi for several reasons one was a harsh law enacted by mr sisi in may making it virtually impossible for some nongovernmental organizations to operate freely in egypt the other was egypt s close relationship with north korea which stretches back to the 1970s but has become a serious irritant amid the recent surge in tensions between washington and pyongyang

where they want to go other organizations in new york that depend on volunteers also reported increases in volunteers this year and traffic on a volunteering website maintained by the city has risen 20 percent in the past six months city officials consider the site an important measure of interest because nonprofit groups post openings for volunteers there nationally the online service volunteermatch has seen activity on its website climb by 7 percent in june compared with june 2016 its president greg baldwin said the site showed increases in crisis support advocacy and hunger immigration and veterans affairs but the largest increase nearly 199 percent was in the category volunteermatch calls politics the 16 volunteer jobs listed recently on its website were for nonpartisan

reported a 15 percent increase in volunteers from its website from nov 8 to april 1 the through line is we ve heard from many people who are reaching out for the first time emily lo bue its director of corporate and volunteer relations said sanctuary for families uses about 3000 volunteers a year she said including lawyers who donate their time or whose time is donated by law firms the higher numbers came as city hall completed a study which was started before the election that said 48 percent of new yorkers volunteer in some way more than three times the rate reported in the corporation

than the national numbers indicated the survey provided data as city officials looked at ways to strengthen volunteer networks around the city advertisement continue reading the main story the national report said volunteers tended to be people who were older nativeborn english speakers and collegeeducated and owned their own homes and had higher incomes in the city ms gavin said the most striking pattern we found in the course of the study was high levels of volunteering even among new yorkers who don t fit many of these characteristics among the people interviewed 457 percent of those earning 20000 to 40000 said they did some type of volunteer work a slightly smaller percentage than among those earning 40000 to 100000 485 percent or those making more than 100000 50 percent as for education 519 percent of those with college degrees did volunteer work and 633 percent with graduate degrees did so according to the new york study but the percentage for those who did not finish high school was 457 percent slightly higher than for those with high school diplomas that study also found that the largest number volunteered through religious groups 304 percent compared with 179 percent who volunteered through school groups 116 percent through community service groups and 71 percent through neighborhood associations how much the respondents interest in volunteering was prompted by national events like president trump s election and inauguration was unclear laura rog the city s director of volunteer strategy and development said most of the interviews were conducted before the election i think we re uncovering that people were engaged all along she said among those who said they did not volunteer time pressures were by far the biggest factor more than 76 percent of new yorkers who did not volunteer in the past year cited time demands ms rog says new yorkers spend more time commuting to work than people in other places do and that cuts into the time they could allot for activities like volunteering another 10 percent said they had not volunteered because no one had asked them to and 96 percent said they did not find the volunteer activities that were available interesting or felt they could not make an individual impact mr lipsmeyer the new york cares volunteer said he had taken on a second volunteer job delivering flowers at a home for older adults in cobble hill he said it had been unexpectedly emotional advertisement continue reading the main story he described making the rounds and assuring a resident that the flowers were free then he

when the tweeterinchief castigated senate republicans as total quitters for failing to repeal the affordable care act he couldn t have been more wrong in fact they showed zombielike relentlessness in their determination to take health care away from millions of americans shambling forward despite devastating analyses by the congressional budget office denunciations of their plans by every major medical group and overwhelming public disapproval photo put it this way senator lindsey graham was entirely correct when he described the final effort at repeal as terrible policy and horrible politics a disaster and a fraud he voted for it anyway and so did 48 of his colleagues so where did this zombie horde come from who ate republicans brains as many people have pointed out when it came to health care republicans were basically caught in their own web of lies they fought against the idea of universal coverage then denounced the affordable care act for failing to cover enough people they made skin in the game ie high outofpocket costs the centerpiece of their health care ideology then denounced the act for high deductibles when they finally got their chance at repeal the contrast between what they had promised and their actual proposals produced widespread and justified public revulsion but the stark dishonesty of the republican jihad against obamacare itself demands an explanation for it went well beyond normal political spin for seven years a whole party kept insisting that black was white and up was down advertisement continue reading the main story and that kind of behavior doesn t come out of nowhere the republican health care debacle was the culmination of a process of intellectual and moral deterioration that began four decades ago at the very dawn of modern movement conservatism that is during the very era antitrump conservatives now point to as the golden age of conservative thought

mr rosenstein added nobody is directing us and nobody is going to direct us about which cases to pursue but even if developing headlines are not rippling through the department in real time i ve made a point of telling my people they should not be monitoring the breaking news mr rosenstein said the attacks by mr trump including his firing of the acting attorney general and the fbi director as well as calls to investigate a political opponent have reverberated loudly all the same mr sessions is carrying out the president s conservative agenda with headturning speed roiling critics on the left and leaving some career staff members within the department disoriented by the sea change sessions as attorney general has been everything conservatives could have dreamed of and liberals could have feared said erwin chemerinsky dean of the law school at the university of california berkeley in the last six months the attorney general has rolled back obamaera policies on gay rights voting rights and criminal justice and police reform while advancing his own fight against drugs gangs and violent crime the scope of the work goes far beyond the investigation into russia s interference in last year s election and possible ties to the trump campaign if you just read the media stories you get a very narrow view of what the department of justice is doing mr rosenstein said in an interview on wednesday that s not the way i see it mr sessions has mandated that prosecutors be as tough as possible in charging and sentencing all crimes including drug offenses that carry stiff mandatory minimum prison sentences he has expanded the ability of the police to seize people s assets irrespective of whether they may have been convicted of a crime or even charged and as he presses a hardline immigration agenda he has dispatched additional federal prosecutors to border districts to prosecute immigration cases and has ordered cities and states to fall in line with federal immigration authorities or else face cuts in federal funding on thursday mr sessions attached new conditions to local partnerships focused on reducing crime requiring socalled sanctuary cities like baltimore to honor federal requests to detain people suspected of being undocumented immigrants if they wanted to participate on friday mr sessions is expected to announce several investigations into leaking a

as the cabinet member most effectively delivering on the president s promises we re heartened by his nononsense approach to criminal justice said james o pasco jr the former executive director of the fraternal order of police and now a senior adviser to that organization s president he s using the bully pulpit to show his support for law enforcement and make cities safer photo although it will take time for the full effects of the new policies to be seen legal experts said changes have already taken root brett tolman a former united states attorney in utah during the administration of george w bush said mr sessions s policies on criminal charging and sentencing had already drastically affected some of his clients in federal cases not just limited to drugs in conversations with assistant united states attorneys around the country mr tolman said the prosecutors cited mr sessions s directives in refusing to negotiate in situations they previously would have there is a definite difference in the mentality of the department of justice and you see it already said mr tolman who previously worked as counsel to senator orrin g hatch republican of utah mr tolman praised past bipartisan progress on criminal justice reform and said mr sessions was out of step this is the 1980s and 90s mentality and an absolute 180degree reversal from what we ve learned newsletter sign up

reassurance beyond personal attacks the president has taken broader swipes at the department for how it has defended his travel ban which aimed to close the nation s borders to travelers from certain predominantly muslim countries he has also called for criminal inquiries into hillary clinton while calling the russia investigation a witch hunt the tension between the justice department s leadership and the president however has made some career prosecutors and senior officials including supporters of the administration s agenda uneasy according to more than two dozen current and former justice department officials advertisement continue reading the main story since may mr rosenstein has addressed an array of justice department staff members from the public integrity section in washington to field offices of federal prosecutors in nevada and south carolina seeking to deliver a simple message business as usual as the justice department operates with only a handful of officials confirmed by the senate including mr sessions mr rosenstein and christopher a wray the new fbi director the administration has sought to put in place other permanent leadership mr rosenstein and mr sessions have spent some saturdays this summer meeting with united states attorney candidates to recommend to the president to replace the 46 united states attorneys mr trump forced out this spring as of friday the administration had made 32 nominations which mr rosenstein cited as an illustration that we re moving fairly quickly others say the vacancies have certain divisions on autopilot prosecutors are less likely to take risks or act with a broader sense of strategy said kerry b harvey a former united states attorney for the eastern district of kentucky during the obama administration when you have a long period of time where you don t have presidential appointees the daytoday work gets done but it tends to be somewhat directionless mr harvey said adding that it s ironic the president s comments seem to be calculated to weaken the department of justice s ability to implement his agenda but as the department presses on with the administration s agenda its officials have not wholly turned a blind eye to their place in protecting established government norms among the paintings that mr rosenstein selected to decorate his conference room at the justice department is a portrait of edward h levi appointed attorney general by president gerald r ford in 1975 after the department s credibility had been eroded by president richard m nixon whose firing of

the statement which was released monday and is conspicuously addressed not to president trump or any other official but rather to the broad unnamed public begins there are times in the life of a nation or a president or a state attorney general when one is called upon to respond directly to the voice of hate mr baxley s example it continues without directly quoting it should serve as inspiration for all who seek to equivocate in times of moral crisis newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the racerelated newsletter join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of new york times journalists please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york timess products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters mr baxley obviously spoke with real clarity he just made it as clear as a human being can make it said james e tierney a former maine attorney general who helped pull the joint statement together he said it clearly at great political risk and maybe personal risk to himself at the time the signatories represent both major parties and 36 of the 50 states as well as the district of columbia guam and puerto rico mr baxley 76 who called the statement one of the most touching gestures that anybody s ever made on my behalf said that was the most meaningful part when you look down that list there s many fine republicans as well as democrats he said and that s the way it ought to be on issues like this condemning sheer hatred though the decision not to address the statement to anyone in particular was deliberate we re not trying to lobby anybody mr tierney said the context is clear it has been less than two weeks since a man drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters at a rally of white supremacists and neonazis in charlottesville va and one week since mr trump doubled down on his assertion that both sides were responsible much of the national conversation since then has focused on mr trump s refusal to do exactly what the statement urges unequivocally condemn hate and those who espouse it i had no absolutely no patience for them or for public officials that didn t stand up to them mr baxley said of the kkk a majority of southerners also opposed the kkk in the 1970s he recalled but yet they didn t speak up advertisement continue reading the main story mr baxley who now works at a law firm in alabama was not involved in writing monday s statement but said he agreed with its message anybody that espouses that rhetoric and that doctrine is not just expressing a difference of opinion they re advocating the most horrific acts that you can imagine towards innocent people he said it just cannot be tolerated in a just society or else you get something like you had in nazi germany you just can t allow that to take root mr tierney now a lecturer at harvard law school emphasized in an interview that mr baxley s stance had been politically risky for an alabama official in the 1970s and that he said was the example he and the other former attorneys general wanted to remind people of we re politicians we do what we have to do to get elected but you know we draw the line and bill drew the line mr tierney said we wanted to give his courageous act voice at a time when the country needs to hear that there are courageous voices

by contrast the president has singled out few democrats saving his criticism for their leadership you can t make sense of it from any normal political perspective said whit ayres a republican pollster the effect is going to be to have congressional republicans take off on their own and accomplish as much as they can brian walsh a former adviser to the national republican senatorial committee said that mr trump s attacks on his own party were shortsighted and selfdestructive but that unfortunately he shows no sign of letting up the president s governing philosophy appears to be if it feels good do it but when he attacks his republican allies he s not only helping senate democrats but he s hurting his ability to get his agenda through congress mr walsh said at her briefing on friday ms sanders was asked how the president would advance legislation with a slim republican majority when he attacked his own party she shifted the blame to congress saying i think it s clear that the end game is for congress to do its job and actually pass legislation i think the american people are very frustrated with congress s lack of action some of mr trump s closest allies say that he believes he cannot go wrong attacking his own party having won a presidential race doing just that or separating himself from an unpopular congress and some white house advisers say the president needs to

trump would be able to shift the blame if his plan for tax cuts meets the same fate as his push for a health care repeal mr trump s brewing feud with mr corker is even more remarkable because mr corker is the rare republican senator who has developed something of a personal relationship with the president mr corker was seen as a possible running mate for mr trump and then a contender to be secretary of state and the two speak regularly advertisement continue reading the main story in april they had dinner and in june mr corker was spotted outside the white house along with peyton manning the former nfl quarterback after mr trump s motorcade returned from a trip to trump national golf club in virginia in conversations with reporters on capitol hill mr corker has made clear that he is no fan of mr trump s carefree tweeting at times he has been unable to contain his exasperation with the administration saying at one point that the white house was in a downward spiral but he has also spoken highly of the president praising mr trump s first foreign trip for having been executed to near perfection as the chairman of the foreign relations committee mr corker has a powerful perch in the senate and the administration has no choice but to work with him on friday tennessee s senior senator lamar alexander a republican offered a vote of confidence in the relationship between the president and mr corker there is no senator no republican senator who president trump talks to more than bob corker mr alexander said i know that for a fact they have great respect for one another so my reaction is maybe it s time for them to play another round of golf together joe carr a former republican state representative in tennessee who said he was considering running for the senate next year when mr corker could seek a third term took exception to mr corker s criticism of mr trump you don t publicly shame and humiliate the president he said it just seems those republican establishment globalists like bob corker have an agenda to change the president by any means necessary said mr carr who won about 40 percent of the vote when he challenged mr alexander in a primary in 2014 i want the president to resist that influence and stick to his promises mr trump s distance from the republican party was noted by the editorial page of the wall street journal which has often been supportive of his agenda a biographer says donald trump once told him that he informed second wife marla maples he was seeking a divorce by leaking it to the new york post the journal said in an editorial on friday president trump now seems to be using twitter to tell republicans in congress that he s divorcing them or at least seeking a trial separation and for its own selfpreservation the gop congress is going to have to find different living arrangements advertisement continue reading the main story mr ayres said that republicans in congress seemed set to do just that and i think they re prepared to do that now he said they understand that s how things are going to get done

the photographs from charlottesville va last weekend tell multiple stories they document a rally unite the right where a protest over the removal of a confederate monument served as a smokescreen for spewing racist and antisemitic hate they show the counterprotesters who gathered to uphold the values of democracy and justice they depict the murder and injury of some of these courageous individuals some of the most fascinating and telling photographs focus on groups of enraged men carrying tiki torches and shouting racist and antisemitic slogans as they marched through the streets of charlottesville perhaps the most significant implication of these images is the extent to which neonazism and white supremacy have entered a new era a movement mainstreamed by its followers and enabled by a sitting president these photographs and startling video footage portrayed neonazis and white supremacists not as abstract figures lurking in shadows or concealed by hoods but as proud men and women openly displaying their bigotry their visibility also made them identifiable so much so that a twitter account yes you re racist circulated photos of them in an effort to publicly expose and shame them the photographic documentation of hate has typically stressed the consequences of bigotry violence and genocide to demonstrate its gravity the shattered glassstrewn german streets jewish businesses and synagogues that were photographed as the sun rose on the devastation of kristallnacht in november 1938 stark pictures of young people clinging to a building as bull connor s troops targeted them with forceful water jets during the children s crusade in birmingham ala in 1963 a dying philando castile his bloodied and lifeless body livestreamed last summer by his girlfriend after he was shot by the police during a traffic stop near st paul photo but some of the most consequential photographs of racial discord like the images out of charlottesville focus not on the victim but on the perpetrator they reveal what pictures of oppression violence and destruction generally do not the ordinary people who typically perpetuate white supremacy these people are sons and daughters siblings spouses and parents who today have traded klan hoods for polo shirts and khakis many are college educated and employed in white collar jobs they look like people we know friends coworkers neighbors and family and they have one thing in common an allegiance to a scurrilous ideology bent on intimidating disempowering and even annihilating africanamericans jews and others they view as foreign or racially impure a former fbi agent michael german who went undercover with neonazi and white supremacist groups observed on cnn that the most perilous threat comes from activists who blend into mainstream society it wasn t necessarily the skinhead with the tattoos and the club who was dangerous mr german said but somebody who wore a suit and went to work in an office and was college educated and much more capable as a threat than some drunk skinhead photo the mainstreaming of hate is not new cameras have revealed the ordinariness of racist and antisemitic agitators the freshfaced zealots of the hitler youth the familyminded nazi sympathizers of the germanamerican bund the welldressed lynch mobs posing before black and mexican bodies dangling from trees or the unrequited rage of a white teenager her face contorted in fury as she screams at an africanamerican student integrating a high school in little rock ark but now president trump s seeming inability to forcefully condemn as terrorism the actions of domestic hate groups enables them in ways that are unprecedented to ignore dismiss or manipulate the implications of these photographs is to further the injustices they represent as donald j trump draws moral equivalence between the forces of racist and antisemitic hate and the men and women who stood up to them he reveals a distorted sense of right and wrong we cannot ignore the logic of president trump s words which would equate the rebellious inmates of the warsaw ghetto with the nazi collaborators who imprisoned and murdered them or condemn the brave young people of the children s crusade as they rose up against the noxious belief system of jim crow segregation can we credibly argue that these courageous people were morally equivalent to their oppressors photo the photographs of white supremacist rage and resentment in charlottesville do more than affirm that unrepentant bigots live next door to us date our sons and daughters and work in our institutions they also remind us that blindly supporting a president committed to stoking the flames of white supremacy and bigotry is itself an act of complicity a vast majority of americans are good people who are clearly repulsed by what that they have witnessed in the photographs of charlottesville but the very ordinariness of the people these images bluntly represent underscores that bigotry is not solely perpetrated at the extremes and as something exceptional it is everywhere having infiltrated every corner of society and culture in places and institutions on the right left and

you know you really do have to ask yourself where does it stop he added comparing the removal of statues to changing history advertisement continue reading the main story mr trump s comments drew strongly negative reactions on twitter from many historians who condemned his false equivalence between the white nationalists and the counterprotesters but where does it stop and what counts as erasing history is a question scholars and others have asked in much more nuanced ways as calls have come to remove monuments not just to the confederacy but to erstwhile liberal heroes and pillars of the democratic party like andrew jackson a slave owner who as president carried out native american removal and woodrow wilson who as president oversaw the segregation of the federal bureaucracy photo the debates that started two or three years ago have saturated the culture so much that even the president is now talking about them said john fabian witt a professor of history at yale which earlier this year announced that it would remove john c calhoun s name from a residential college mr witt called mr trump s warning of a slippery slope a red herring there have been after all no calls to tear down the washington monument annette gordonreed a professor of history and law at harvard who is credited with breaking down the wall of resistance among historians to the idea that jefferson had a sexual relationship with sally hemings said that the answer to mr trump s hypothetical question about whether getting rid of robert e lee and stonewall jackson also meant junking washington and jefferson was a simple no there is a crucial difference between leaders like washington and jefferson imperfect men who helped create the united states ms gordonreed said and confederate generals like jackson and lee whose main historical significance is that they took up arms against it the comparison she added also misapprehends the moral problem with the confederacy photo this is not about the personality of an individual and his or her flaws she said this is about men who organized a system of government to maintain a system of slavery and to destroy the american union as for the idea of erasing history it s a possibility most scholars do not take lightly but james grossman the executive director of the american historical association said that mr trump s comments failed to recognize the difference between history and memory which is always shifting advertisement continue reading the main story when you alter monuments you re not changing history he said you re changing how we remember history some critics of confederate monuments have called for them to be moved to museums rather than destroyed or even left in place and reinterpreted to explain the context in which they were created mr grossman noted that most confederate monuments were constructed in two periods the 1890s as jim crow was being established and in the 1950s during a period of mass southern resistance to the civil rights movement photo we would not want to whitewash our history by pretending that jim crow and disenfranchisement or massive resistance to the civil rights movement never happened he said that is the part of our history that these monuments testify to how the events in charlottesville and mr trump s comments will affect the continuing debate over confederate monuments remains to be seen mr witt for one suggested that white nationalist support might backfire he noted that it was the 2015 murder of nine africanamerican churchgoers in charleston sc by a white supremacist that led to the removal of the confederate flag from statehouse grounds the amazing thing is that the president is doing more to endanger historical monuments than most of the protesters he said the altright is producing a world where there is more pressure to remove monuments rather than less

in his comments to reporters on thursday mr trump made clear that he was drafting paperwork and intended to issue a formal declaration that the opioid crisis was a national emergency much the way the federal government officially recognizes the need for a national response to natural disasters we re going to draw it up and we re going to make it a national emergency he said it is a serious problem the likes of which we have never had you know when i was growing up they had the lsd and they had certain generations of drugs there s never been anything like what s happened to this country over the last four or five years mr trump has repeatedly promised that the federal government will confront the spreading crisis of opioid overdoses in 2015 officials said 33000 of the 52000 overdose deaths nationwide were the result of the use of opioids like heroin and fentanyl after a briefing from health officials this week mr trump called the issue of opioid overdoses a tremendous problem in our country and he said that he hoped that we get it taken care of as well as it can be taken care of newsletter sign up continue reading the main story get the morning briefing by email what you need to know to start your day delivered to your inbox monday through friday please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york timess products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters the opioid commission recommended declaring an emergency under the stafford act which is usually reserved for natural disasters or under the public health service act which also activates federal assistance to states but is carried out by the department of health and human services in a statement on thursday afternoon mr christie thanked the president for following the panel s suggestion i am completely confident that the president will address this problem aggressively and do all he can to alleviate the suffering and loss of scores of families in every corner of our country mr christie said advertisement continue reading the main story mr price said this week that most such declarations are for a specific outbreak of an infectious disease such as the threat from the zika virus or are limited geographically to a specific location like hurricane sandy which hit the new jersey coast in 2012 president barack obama declared a national emergency as sandy headed for the east coast that year and he used his authority to declare an emergency in 2009 during the h1n1 influenza pandemic white house and federal health officials did not respond to requests for more information about how mr trump decided that an emergency declaration is necessary despite the comments to the contrary from his advisers declaring an emergency could allow states and cities that are hard hit by the opioid crisis to receive federal disaster relief funds and other types of urgent aid just as they do after hurricanes or tornadoes through the federal emergency management agency it could also allow certain federal rules to be waived temporarily for example allowing medicaid funds to be used for something they normally are not or allowing access to experimental medications if you declare a state of emergency you can move federal resources more easily between programmatic areas said michael fraser the executive director of the association of state and territorial health officials he added however that when it comes to opioids it s really unclear what kind of effect a federal emergency declaration would have six states alaska arizona florida maryland massachusetts and virginia have already declared emergencies because of the opioid crisis these declarations have helped expand access to naloxone a medication that can revive people who have overdosed according to the network for public health law they have also helped states get federal grants for treatment services and improved reporting of overdoses the 21st century cures act which congress approved last year is already sending states 1 billion over two years for opioid addiction treatment and prevention but experts say it is far short of what is needed ohio alone spent nearly 1 billion last year on addressing the opioid epidemic

the exodus began monday when merck s chief executive said he was resigning from mr trump s manufacturing council citing the president s tepid early statement on the violence in charlottesville where

view all new york times newsletters having come into office boasting of his business bona fides mr trump was quick to forge ties with the corporate world central to these efforts was the formation of the business advisory groups made up of executives who would help shape policy discussions dozens of prominent business leaders joined the panels and in the first weeks of mr trump s presidency numerous meetings were held at the white house yet the early momentum dissipated and few meetings of the advisory groups have been held since for the chief executive of intel who stepped down from the manufacturing council on monday the journey from engagement with the new president to a public breakup played out over the course of months brian krzanich the intel chief was curious about the trump movement and during the campaign planned to hold a fundraiser for mr trump at his home to hear his views only to cancel it after an outcry in silicon valley nevertheless when intel decided to expand a plant in arizona in february mr krzanich called mr trump and joined the president to announce it at the white house even though the longplanned project was initially announced with president obama yet mr krzanich has publicly disagreed with mr trump on key issues like the president s proposed immigration ban in january and the decision to withdraw from the paris climate accords the president s response to the weekend s violence in charlottesville va was the final straw in a thinly veiled reference to mr trump mr krzanich wrote that he was disturbed by people in washington who seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them in a nod to the protesters who challenged the white supremacists as well as to kenneth c frazier the chief executive of merck who quit the council early on monday in protest of mr trump s actions mr krzanich added we should honor not attack those who have stood up for equality and other cherished american values advertisement continue reading the main story after deliberating over the weekend and on monday with senior executives and other advisers mr krzanich notified the council of his decision in writing on monday night and published a blog post explaining it the willingness of mr krzanich and other ceos to walk away from the advisory panels highlights an uncomfortable reality for mr trump he billed himself as the businessmanpresident but some executives no longer want to work with him this should be his strong suit courting ceos said douglas brinkley a presidential historian at rice university instead trump finds himself with ceos not wanting to be in a photo op with the president what should have been an honor has become an albatross many executives remain on the various councils including the leaders of boeing amazon and oracle and since taking office mr trump has met with hundreds of business leaders several people involved in the panels also say that they can have a real impact on policy earlier this year members of one of the advisory groups urged the president not regard china as a currency manipulator that input from a group led by the blackstone chief executive steve schwarzman seemed to inspire a change of stance on mr trump s part that may have smoothed relations with that country even those companies that decided to remain on the panels have debated about how to proceed general electric which on monday said its chairman jeffrey immelt would continue to advise the president did so after careful deliberation a handful of top ge executives worked on a statement that acknowledged what the company s values are condemning bigotry and racism they did not check with the board but did consult with ge diversity groups including the one representing africanamericans in the company to ensure that the statement was in sync with the pulse of the company before releasing the statement according to a person with knowledge of ge s thinking the president s business advisers are in a quandary said jeffrey pfeffer professor of organizational behavior at stanford s business school among the considerations ceos must weigh when contemplating whether to step down from the advisory groups the benefits of having a seat at the table the political preferences of employees and customers and the potential consequences of slighting the president photo it s easier and it s less offensive to not take the position in the first place than to take it and to relatively quickly six months later say whoops i m out of here mr pfeffer said now you re offending him so i m sure the calculus changes advertisement continue reading the main story on monday mr frazier of merck kevin plank of under armour and mr krzanich of intel stepped down from the manufacturing council and tuesday morning scott paul the president of the american alliance for manufacturing a nonprofit group said on twitter that he too was stepping down from the manufacturing council because it s the right thing for me to do after mr trump on tuesday equivocated in his criticism of farright hate groups richard trumka the president of the aflcio and thea lee the deputy chief of staff also stepped down we cannot sit on a council for a president who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism mr trumka said president trump s remarks today repudiate his forced remarks yesterday about the kkk and neonazis we must resign on behalf of america s working people who reject all notions of legitimacy of these bigoted groups crossing a famously sensitive president has its risks during the news conference tuesday trump again took aim at merck criticizing the company for manufacturing its products overseas we want products made in the country he said during the news conference on monday he similarly accused the company on twitter of taking jobs out of the us a company spokeswoman declined to comment on trump s claim that the company was moving jobs abroad some companies on the council including boeing and lockheed martin do substantial business with the government adding another complex dynamic to their calculations but the consensus among business leaders was that the risks of crossing mr trump had diminished in recent months the risk calculus has changed dramatically said scott galloway a professor at new york university business school who sits on several corporate boards

some conservatives argue that s fine the less dc does the better let the market rule i disagree what actually made america great was a government that prepared the right soil in education regulation immigration research and infrastructure and a dynamic private sector that grew all kinds of flowers in that soil advertisement continue reading the main story which brings me to china china takes governing seriously in a cruel way and in an impressive way its leaders wake up every morning and ask themselves two questions first how do we stay in power their answer which i find reprehensible is we ll use technology to repress our people i think in the long run depriving china s people of freedom a basic human right will undermine their ability to realize their full potential but it has worked better than expected up to now because china s leaders are just as focused on asking a second question what world are we living in which leads to what are the biggest forces shaping this world and what kind of national strategy do we need so our people can get the most out of these forces and cushion the worst they know we re in the midst of these three climate changes and have formulated a strategy made in china 2025 to thrive within it it s a plan for building the infrastructure investments education and regulations that will enable chinese companies to lead in supercomputing new materials computercontrolled machine tools industrial robotics space and aviation equipment including drones clean cars clean energy biomedicine and nextgen medical devices newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the opinion today newsletter every weekday get thoughtprovoking commentary from oped columnists the times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york timess products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters only time will tell how much what china has wrong about governing will undermine what it has right by contrast trump hasn t even named a science adviser he pulled out of the paris climate accord without any input from scientists and he proposed a budget for fiscal 2018 that eliminated the department of energy s innovation lab the advanced research projects agency energy and slashed funding for all of our key national science and medical labs which provide the basic research for the very nextgen technologies in which china is now massively investing he s spending the money instead on a wall against mexico is there anything more stupid and then you watch the health care debate and then you realize that in addition to the executive branch one of our two parties has gone nuts for seven years the gop made replacing obamacare which needs improving its top goal and when it finally controlled all the levers of power it was clear that it had done no homework on a better plan or built any intraparty consensus for it it was all a fraud and then you look at all the knife fights between rival trump aides and you realize that none of these fights were over how to thrive in a world challenged by these three climate changes they were all about who could get closest to and flatter our dear leader most but our dear leader as we saw in the health care debate has done no homework on the future either he s been too busy promising to restore the past this is so dangerous when the pace of change accelerates in climate technology and globalization all at once small errors in leadership navigation can have huge consequences it s like a 747 pilot who enters the wrong navigational coordinates you can find yourself so far off course that the pain of getting back will be staggering we have such a pilot it is time for the adult republicans and democrats in congress to come together and take the helm

you know that american politics has jumped the rails when a us contractor is relieved to get back from america to his little base in afghanistan anyway enough of that since i can t explain trump s middle east let me explain what i saw here three things in particular i saw a new way of mounting warfare by the united states in iraq i saw in this new warfare a strategy that offers at least a glimmer of hope for iraq if and when isis is defeated but though only a glimpse i saw in afghanistan an eroding stalemate with all the same issues that have undermined stability there for years government corruption distrust among afghans and perfidious interventions by pakistan and iran the best way for me to explain what s new in iraq is with a scene i watched unfold on saturday we were at the joint strike cell in erbil in iraqi kurdistan this is where multiple air force television feeds come in live from drones u2s satellites and us and coalition fighter jets the officers there are coordinating with iraqi army combat forces on the ground and their us military advisers embedded just behind the battlefront to hit isis targets as the iraqi army begins its push west having retaken mosul the iraqi army is driving isis into the euphrates river valley where it looks like it will make a last stand this was the second day of the iraqis thrust west and they were already meeting resistance in a small town on the road to isiscontrolled tal afar several us eyes in the sky were trained on a singlestory flatroof building about 30 feet wide sandwiched between two larger buildings iraqi soldiers crawling toward this building were receiving lots of smallarms fire from inside stalling their advance about 500 feet away their us advisers were sending all this information to the strike cell in real time meanwhile in the strike cell team members sitting in front of computer screens were calculating exactly how much firepower was required to kill the isis fighters and not hurt any civilians who might be nearby they did a quick tally of the remaining weapons on the american fighter aircraft in the area seeing which had what smart bombs left seconds later a call of weapon away 30 seconds rang out as an f15e released a 500pound gpsguided smart bomb the screen rebroadcasting the f15e s targeting pod showed the bomb going straight down through the roof we have splash said one of the controllers in a monotone as a huge plume of smoke engulfed the video screen quickly the smoke cleared and the 30footwide building was smoldering rubble but the two buildings to the sides were totally intact so any civilians inside should be unhurt advertisement continue reading the main story the officer in charge told me that a few weeks earlier during the campaign to retake mosul two iraqi soldiers were wounded and hiding from an isis unit inside a building 15 yards away using laser targeting the us team fired a rocket whose size direction and shape were chosen to take down only the isis building and make its walls fall in the opposite direction of the two pinneddown iraqis the rocket worked as intended and they were rescued this is war in iraq today in a nutshell for years we ve measured our involvement in middle east wars by one pair of indexes boots on the ground and killed in action because of that most americans are now paying scant attention to iraq where our boots on the ground have shrunk to a few thousand and where there have been just 17 us military deaths since we reengaged in iraq to defeat isis in 2014 but the real story is wings in the air we are involved in a gigantic military enterprise in iraq but it s with massive conventional air power married to unconventional special forces who are advising the iraqi army that is actually doing the ground fighting this is making our presence in iraq much more sustainable for us and for the iraqis ironically it might never have happened had president barack obama not withdrawn our combat troops from iraq in 2011 because iraqis couldn t agree on a legal formula for their staying after that the thenshiiteled iraqi government began abusing sunnis and isis emerged in response that forced iraqis to rethink their relationship with us a us air force special operations officer told me of returning to iraq in early 2014 and meeting with the iraqi counterterrorism service the only truly professional nonsectarian fighting unit then left in the country the us officer had come to ask the cts what material aid the us could offer in the fight against isis and the cts commander responded

when george w bush invaded iraq in 2003 to topple saddam hussein we destroyed the government from the top down we toppled saddam s statue and we were advised largely by iraqi exiles of dubious legitimacy in local eyes it became our war producing iconic pictures of us soldiers kicking down doors and pointing guns at cowering women even though isis emerged after we left we have now returned at the invitation of iraqis from the bottom up not exiles making our presence much more legitimate and sustainable for any long fight iraqi sunnis shiites and kurds were forced to unify at least minimally to defeat isis opening new possibilities advertisement continue reading the main story this is iraq s war of liberation they own it i met marine col seth folsom who commands a forward special operations air base alasad in the western iraqi desert it was 120 degrees outside but he had a bounce in his step i was here in 2003 and in 2008 he told me in those days if he had a convoy going through a town it would speed 100 miles an hour not to get shot at or blown up pushing iraqi cars out of the way creating resentments now we are driving with the iraqis it s a paradigm shift it doesn t even seem like the same country to me now i am saying to my iraqi counterparts what do you want to do so we are fighting a very different war in iraq which trump has amped up but you can t grasp its true dimensions unless you go to the overall us regional air headquarters in qatar and watch on giant screens a 247 choreography that boggles the mind b52s u2s f16s f22s f35s f15s a10s c17s v22s u28s c130s jstars awacs satellites and unmanned reapers and predators all fueled aloft by a fleet of kc10 and kc135 flying gas stations that have conducted 23934 strikes on isis targets in iraq and syria using 84585 precisionguided bombs since we came back in 2014 there is much still to worry about at the joint operations headquarters in baghdad us officers plan on computer screens and the iraqi planners on wallsize maps with markers and blue arrows representing troops that they move around it can drive american planners crazy when speed is of the essence more worrying american advisers at the joint operations headquarters told me that many of their iraqi counterparts take their uniforms off before they go home at night not everyone respects them for working with the americans particularly in the hardline shiite areas some have even had to change houses and yet they still show up and their men still fought housetohouse to recapture mosul taking huge casualties at the height of the battle for mosul the us air force field hospital at alasad air base treated many iraqi soldiers the us officer who heads the hospital told us that when the first iraqi wounded soldier arrived and he desperately needed blood the us commander asked for six volunteers some 50 american military personnel showed up to donate it is one thing for us to be respectful of the iraqis and another to respect the iraqis the air force chief of staff gen dave goldfein remarked to me today there is mutual respect we admire their tenacity all of that said i am still wary there is no slamdunk here while isis is on the run lasting victory in iraq depends entirely on whether iraqis can come together not just to fight a shared enemy but to build a shared government the morning after isis is defeated advertisement continue reading the main story alas there is no powersharing bomb that we can drop on the iraqi parliament that will make sunnis shiites and kurds trust one another enough to live together as equal citizens and there is no culturebuster bomb that we can drop that will burrow deep into iraqiarab culture and stop them from always letting their past bury their future and instead start letting their future bury their past culture always trumps strategy and only they can change their political culture as the overall us commander in iraq lt gen stephen townsend put it to me after isis is defeated iraqis need to produce a government for all iraqis it cannot be a government where sunnis feel disenfranchised we better have in place a strategy for coaching iraqis on powersharing as much as we did on dynamic targeting otherwise the morning after isis 10 is defeated we ll see isis 20 the war in afghanistan is different the air power component is there but us special forces are still doing too much fighting and dying and trump talked on monday night like they will now do more and we don t have the legitimacy you now feel in iraq personal security for our afghan allies is still minimal i stood on the tarmac at bagram airfield and listened as a ustrained afghan pilot explained that the last thing he does before climbing into the cockpit is call home to be sure his kids have not been abducted by the taliban who know that he works with the us and have threatened him repeatedly again the fact that this pilot is still ready to fly with the us shows real courage he wants something different for his country and he s not alone but is he in the majority clearly he s got neighbors who don t think that we or the afghan government we re supporting are legitimate culture trumps strategy this is going to take ages to fix and if you fix afghanistan well you fix afghanistan so what if you fix iraq with a real powersharing accord you create a model that can radiate out across the arab world because iraq is a microcosm of the arab world with sunnis shiites kurds turkmen christians and many others i slept well in the us embassy green zone in baghdad which is protected outside by iraqis two nights earlier we slept at the bagram base near kabul and were repeatedly awakened by a blaring loudspeaker saying take cover because another rocket was coming in for the moment and i stress moment we have a sustainable military strategy to defeat isis in iraq but a sustainable political outcome depends on iraqis rising to the occasion i do not see that in afghanistan and i did not hear it in trump s speech i fear our choices there are unchanged lose early lose late lose big or lose small

photo washington president trump had promised that his mix of tax cuts deregulation and reductions in wasteful spending would spur economic growth and cure america s ailing fiscal health on thursday an independent government analysis of those proposals effectively said not so much the congressional budget office cast mr trump s inaugural budget as overly optimistic expressing doubt about his promises to balance the federal budget the budget projected that by 2027 the economy would achieve a small budget surplus but according to the budget office the deficit would remain at 720 billion or 26 percent of gross domestic product comparing deficit estimates how much the deficit is expected to grow under current law how much the deficit is expected to change under trump s budget according to the white house congressional budget office 17 27 17 27 17 27 1 of gdp 2 3 4 how much the deficit is expected to grow under current law how much the deficit is expected to change under trump s budget according to the white house the congressional budget office 17 27 17 27 17 27 1 of gdp 2 3 4 how much the deficit is expected to grow under current law how much the deficit is expected to change under trump s budget according to the congressional budget office the white house 17 27 17 27 17 27 1 of gdp 2 3 4 the assessment comes after the trump administration was criticized in may for releasing a budget that economists said relied on overly rosy growth estimates it was also panned for using questionable math and offering minimal detail about the president s tax plan a central component in mr trump s plans for improving the economy one of the biggest reasons the trump budget fell short is that the budget office did not agree that its proposals would generate as much economic growth as the white house has suggested it said that the average gross domestic product growth over 10 years is currently 18 and that under mr trump s plan it would be 19 percent far lower than the 3 percent the administration assumes advertisement continue reading the main story the lack of specifics in mr trump s plans was also a problem for the congressional budget office it said that in many cases where mr trump s policy initiatives lacked details its analysts had to use placeholder figures

these sorts of questions revolve around one big question what lessons are people drawing from this debacle and how will those lessons shape what comes next it s clear that trump is not just a parenthesis after he leaves things will not just snap back to normal instead he represents the farcical culmination of a lot of dying old orders demographic political even moral and what comes after will be a reaction against rather than a continuing from newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the opinion today newsletter every weekday get thoughtprovoking commentary from oped columnists the times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york timess products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters for example let s look at our moral culture for most of american history mainline protestants the episcopalians methodists presbyterians and so on set the dominant cultural tone most of the big social movements like abolitionism the suffragist movement and the civil rights movement came out of the mainline churches as joseph bottum wrote in an anxious age mainline protestants created a kind of unifying culture that bound people of different political views you could be catholic jewish muslim or atheist but still you were influenced by certain mainline ideas the protestant work ethic the wasp definition of a gentleman leaders from theodore roosevelt to barack obama hewed to a similar mainline standard for what is decent in public life and what is beyond the pale over the last several decades mainline protestantism has withered the country became more diverse the wasps lost their perch atop society the mainline denominations lost their vitality for a time we lived off the moral capital of the past but the election of trump shows just how desiccated the mainline code has become a nation guided by that ethic would not have elected a guy who is a daily affront to it a guy who nakedly loves money who boasts who objectifies women who is incapable of hypocrisy because he acknowledges no standard of propriety other than that which he feels like doing at any given moment donald trump has smashed through the behavior standards that once governed public life his election demonstrates that as the unifying glue of the mainline culture receded the country divided into at least three blocks white evangelical protestantism that at least in its public face seems to care more about eros than caritas secular progressivism that is spiritually formed by feminism environmentalism and the quest for individual rights and realist nationalism that gets its manners from reality tv and its spiritual succor from ingroupoutgroup solidarity advertisement continue reading the main story if trump falls in disgrace or defeat and people s partisan pride is no longer at stake i hope that even his supporters will have enough moral memory to acknowledge that character really does matter a guy can promise change but if he is dishonest disloyal and selfish the change he delivers is not going to be effective or good but where are people going to go for a new standard of decency they re not going to go back to the old wasp ideal that s dead trump revealed the vacuum but who is going to fill it and with what i could describe a similar vacuum when it comes to domestic policy thinking to american identity to america s role in the world trump exposes the void but doesn t fill it that s why the reaction against trump is now more important than the man himself one way or another i m gonna wash that man right outta what s left of my hair

photo to the editor re rebellion by business leaders spelled end of trump councils front page aug 17 it is gratifying to see america s business community finally emerge from its near comatose level of denial and complicity regarding the depredations of president trump and his administration the resignation of these chief executives certainly sends a message but as we have seen in the past such gestures will have no effect on president trump s behavior only the republicancontrolled congress is in a position to curb his worst impulses and we will see no action until its members realize that they will pay a real price for nonaction this is where corporate america can make a difference if chief executives across the political spectrum begin to heavily shift their campaign contributions from republican to democratic candidates for the house and the senate in 2018 in the realization that the future of the united states is on the line and with it their future profits it will surely be noticed and then we may see some real action from congress advertisement continue reading the main story so the question is are these ceos and their colleagues willing to go beyond mere gestures and exert the kind of influence that congress understands by voting with their money if so then there is hope if not then who cares about a handful of token resignations

of that just 8 percentage points will result from medical inflation and 2 percentage points will stem from the reinstatement of an obamacare health insurance tax the balance will be related to the uncertainty that mr trump has created around key pieces of obamacare advertisement continue reading the main story the largest portion of the total about 15 percentage points is connected to the potential demise of the costsharing reductions known as csrs payments made by the government to insurers to help cover outofpocket costs like copays and deductibles that lowerincome americans can t afford the congressional budget office said on tuesday that premiums for the most popular health insurance plans would rise by 20 percent next year and federal budget deficits would increase by 194 billion in the coming decade if mr trump ends the subsidies those subsidies which were created by the obama health care legislation and which benefit seven million americans have been in limbo since house republicans sued in 2014 contending that they needed to be appropriated by congress which wasn t going to happen as long as republicans controlled each chamber how costsharing subsidies reduce

stayed pending appeal allowing both the obama and trump administrations to continue to make the monthly payments president trump has threatened to end the subsidies but has yet to take definitive action a decision was promised by aug 4 but mr trump decamped to his new jersey golf resort with nary a word about csrs as a result many of the insurance companies that have already announced their increases have either baked in increases assuming loss of the subsidies or say that they will impose further hikes if the subsidies are not continued the silence around the csrs is consistent with the

health and human services has said repeatedly there are 1442 places in the existing law that provide him with some measure of discretion in how the act is implemented for example the internal revenue service said this year that it would start accepting tax returns even if the filer has not confirmed having insurance or submitting the penalty around the same time the new team pulled advertising designed to encourage enrollments causing signups for 2017 to fall modestly short of expectations especially among younger and healthier americans who are much more likely to wait until the last minute to enroll more recently the administration canceled contracts with two companies that helped americans in 18 cities find plans all of these actions and more could amount to undermining the individual mandate a step that mr gaba says would add another 4 percentage points to 2018 premium increases trump policies raising health premiums breakdown of reasons for 2018 rate hike requests cuts to costsharing subsidies medical inflation nonenforcement of mandate federal health insurance tax total average premium increase 15 8 4 2 29 cuts to costsharing subsidies medical inflation nonenforcement of mandate federal health insurance tax total average premium increase 15 8 4 2 29 at the same time some steps toward preparing for the next enrollment period are proceeding normally such as an annual meeting in june with navigators who guide consumers in their choices of plans in addition the trump team has been allocating funds to states with weak exchange markets to encourage insurers to continue to provide coverage but what else the administration will or won t do as the november opening of the enrollment period approaches remains a mystery advertisement continue reading the main story asked last week by the washington post to clarify a spokeswoman for the centers for medicare and medicaid services would say only as open enrollment approaches we are evaluating how to best serve the american people who access coverage on healthcaregov an hour later the spokeswoman jane norris tried to withdraw the statement and refused to comment further ms norris s office did not respond at all to my inquiry a bipartisan group of senators is trying to draft legislation to stabilize obamacare but with congress gone any new laws will come too late for the sept 5 deadline for setting 2018 premiums so it well may be up to mr trump to decide in effect the fate of the exchanges which supply about 12 million americans with their coverage with final premium increase decisions due soon even inaction could be devastating as the president has acknowledged on occasion and as public opinion polls confirm the failure of congress to pass any legislation means that the new administration owns the health care issue politically continuing to let it flounder in the twilight zone will be damaging not only to mr trump s political health but more important to the health of

in may in israel trump insisted on a much shorter stop at yad vashem an important holocaust memorial and museum than either barack obama or george w bush had made and he stuck to that plan even as many israelis and american jews cried foul the tonedeaf breeziness of his approach was accentuated by the message he left in the visitors book it is a great honor to be here with all of my friends so amazing will never forget as yair rosenberg of the jewish magazine tablet tweeted it was basically just what teenagers write in each other s high school yearbooks ivanka trump went to the warsaw memorial in her father s stead though trump softened that blow somewhat by mentioning in his big warsaw speech that the nazis systematically murdered millions of poland s jewish citizens ivanka converted to judaism to marry jared kushner and the couple s key roles in the white house mean that trump has observant jews at the very core of his presidency and of his life but that didn t stop him from making remarks to jewish republican donors in december 2015 that seemed to play into an antisemitic stereotype i m a negotiator like you folks he said later adding is there anybody that doesn t renegotiate deals in this room perhaps more than any room i ve ever spoken to during his presidential campaign he embraced the favor of groups and people who trafficked in white supremacy he retweeted material from proudly antisemitic twitter feeds and prompted a furor by promoting an image that placed hillary clinton s face atop a pile of cash and beside a sixpointed star on which most corrupt

circle when the image gained attention even so politifact noted trump had an unusual habit of using social media to broadcast material that comes from sources with a history of spreading racism antisemitism or white supremacy i m not convinced that trump is much of an antisemite any more than i m convinced that he s much of a homophobe racism and sexism are another matter but i think he s so thirsty for and intoxicated by whatever love comes his way that he s loath to rebuff the sources of it advertisement continue reading the main story a prominent jewish republican put it well i think trump is such a pathological narcissist that the act of telling people who love you that you reject them he can t get around that he told me interpreting trump s reasoning this way what can be wrong with them they re for me trump is disinclined to denounce any constituency or tactics that elevate him to the throne where he s sure that he belongs the outcome validates even the ugliest and most divisive ascent i don t think he s goading these people or associating with them because he shares their views the republican added i do think that he s so insensitive about the presidency about the responsibilities of the leader of the free world that he doesn t realize it s not enough to say once or twice i don t agree with them he doesn t realize that you have to be very clear and he doesn t realize or care that he s validating and encouraging them he doesn t understand the message of zipping through yad vashem when predecessors lingered because he s less concerned with the weight of his office than with the whims and convenience of donald trump it s all about him always and if he s sure in his own heart that he s good with jews then he shouldn t have to prove it go back to his minitantrum during a white house news conference in february when a reporter for a jewish magazine tried to ask him whether he was paying proper heed to the antisemitic bomb threats trump interpreted the question as an indictment not of his behavior but of his being i am the least antisemitic person that you ve ever seen in your entire life he trumpeted and turned the discussion toward the big bad media forget about any persecution of jews let s talk about the persecution of trump you can be only so considerate to others when you never stop considering yourself and the flamboyantly nonconformist culture of trump s presidency has downsides this administration shrugs off and throws away some rituals and niceties that do matter to people estranging them in the process gay pride month came and went without even a banal word of recognition from the white house so while trump likes to crow in a hallucinatory fashion that gays love him we made do in june with a tweet from his outsourced conscience by which of course i mean ivanka some of this is steve bannon and his ilk their idea of nationalism is chilly to the recognition of subgroups including jewish americans some of it boils down to an absent professionalism trump isn t matching the respectful choreography of other presidents because there s no one in his inner circle familiar with the dance kushner bannon stephen miller and reince priebus are all new to this kind and level of work they lack institutional memory along with any awareness of how easily those blind spots become insensitivity advertisement continue reading the main story i can t know definitively how trump feels about jews or gays or a whole lot else but i can see clearly his sloppiness and selfabsorption and they re cause enough for alarm

that s something that the department of defense and the white house will have to work together as implementation takes place and is done so lawfully sarah huckabee sanders the white house press secretary said still the announcement pleased elements of mr trump s base who have been dismayed to see the president break so bitterly in recent days with attorney general jeff sessions a hardline conservative civil rights and transgender advocacy groups denounced the policy with some vowing to challenge it in court pentagon officials expressed dismay that the president s tweets could open them to lawsuits the ban would reverse the gradual transformation of the military under president barack obama whose administration announced last year that transgender people could serve openly in the military mr obama s defense secretary ashton b carter also opened all combat roles to women and appointed the first openly gay army secretary and it represented a stark turnabout for mr trump who billed himself during the campaign as an ally of gay lesbian bisexual and transgender people the president ms sanders said had concluded that allowing transgender people to serve openly erodes military readiness and unit cohesion and made the decision based on that mr mattis who was on vacation was silent on the new policy people close to the defense secretary said he was appalled that mr trump chose to unveil his decision in tweets in part because of the message they sent to transgender activeduty service members including those deployed overseas that they were suddenly no longer welcome advertisement continue reading the main story the policy would affect only a small portion of the approximately 13 million activeduty members of the military some 2000 to 11000 activeduty troops are transgender according to a 2016 rand corporation study commissioned by the pentagon though estimates of the number of transgender service members have varied widely and are sometimes as high as 15000 the study found that allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military would have minimal impact on readiness and health care costs for the pentagon it estimated that health care costs would rise 24 million to 84 million a year representing an infinitesimal 004 to 013 percent increase in spending citing research into other countries that allow transgender people to serve the study projected little or no impact on unit cohesion operational effectiveness or readiness in the united states lt commander blake dremann a navy supply corps officer who is transgender said he found out his job was in danger when he turned on cnn on wednesday morning commander dremann came out as transgender to his commanders in 2015 and said they had been supportive of him he refused to criticize mr trump we don t criticize our commander in chief he said but said the policy shift is singling out a specific population in the military who had been assured we were doing everything appropriate to continue our honorable service he added and i will continue to do so until the military tells me to hang up my boots the announcement came amid the debate on capitol hill over the obamaera practice of requiring the pentagon to pay for medical treatment related to gender transition representative vicky hartzler republican of missouri has proposed an amendment to the spending bill that would bar the pentagon from spending money on transition surgery or related hormone therapy and other republicans have pressed for similar provisions mr mattis had worked behind the scenes to keep such language out of legislation quietly lobbying republican lawmakers not to attach the prohibitions according to congressional and defense officials but mr trump was concerned that the transgender medical care issue could imperil the security spending measure which also contains 16 billion for the border wall that he has championed and wanted to resolve the dispute cleanly and straightforwardly according to a person familiar with his thinking who insisted on anonymity to describe it that prompted his ban republican congressional leaders were aware mr trump was looking into whether taxpayer money should be spent on medical procedures for transgender service members but had not expected him to go so far as to bar transgender people from serving altogether advertisement continue reading the main story mr trump and republican lawmakers had come under pressure from tony perkins the president of the family research council a leading christian conservative group and an ally of mr trump s mr perkins opposed the bill over spending on transgender medical costs and lobbied lawmakers to do the same grant repentance to president trump and secretary mattis for even considering to keep this wicked policy in place the family research council said in one of its daily prayers last week grant them understanding courage and willpower to stand up to the forces of darkness that gave birth to it and wholly to repeal it opponents of allowing openly transgender service members had raised a number of concerns including what they said was the questionable psychological fitness of those troops they said the military was being used for social experimentation at the expense of national security this was ash carter on his way out the door pulling the pin on a cultural grenade mr perkins said on wednesday our military leaders are saying this doesn t help make us a better fighting force it s a distraction it s taking up limited resources mr carter objected to the decision for its effect on the military and on those considering joining to choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military he said in a statement there are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably this action would also send the wrong signal to a younger generation thinking about

continue reading the main story he called mr trump s move yet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made via twitter senator jack reed democrat of rhode island and the ranking member of the armed services committee noted the irony of mr trump s announcing the ban on the anniversary of president harry truman s order to desegregate the military president trump is choosing to retreat in the march toward equality he said in june the administration delayed by six months a decision on whether to allow transgender recruits to join the military at the time mr mattis said the delay would give military leaders a chance to review the shift s potential impact mr mattis s decision was seen as a pause to finesse the issue one official said not a prelude to an outright ban the delay on recruits was largely based on a disagreement on the science of how mental health care and hormone therapy for transgender individuals would help solve the medical issues that are associated with gender dysphoria gen paul selva the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said during his reconfirmation hearing last week i am an advocate of every qualified person who can meet the physical standards to serve in our uniformed services to be able to do so he said mr mattis a retired marine has not been a major proponent of allowing transgender people to serve in the military in part because medical accommodations including hormone injections could open the defense department to claims from other people not allowed to serve like type 1 diabetics who also need regular injections but mr mattis and the pentagon s military leadership all seemed to have accepted that transgender people already serving in the military would be allowed to remain a senior adviser to mr mattis sally donnelly represented the palm center an organization that advocated on behalf of the lgbt community in the military during the debate that led up to the obama administration s decision to allow transgender people to serve defense officials said mr trump s abrupt decision is likely to end up in court outservesldn a nonprofit group that represents gay lesbian bisexual and transgender

funds raised in the second quarter that is a reversal from mr trump s 2016 campaign when small donors accounted for a majority of the outside donations raised by his committees not including the 66 million he donated to his campaign in some ways the shift to highdollar fundraising represents a move toward a more traditional political operation than the one that helped power mr trump s upset victory in 2016 his campaign relied more on donations from mr trump s own pocket he has not donated to his reelection campaign and on the power of megarallies and his social media presence than on traditional and costly political infrastructure like field offices and television advertising it is unusual however for a sitting president s team to be raising money and building a reelection effort in the first half of a first term when political and fundraising efforts are typically channeled through the president s national party committee the reports show that mr trump s committees spent 229000 on salaries and political and communications consulting the committees spent 21 million on digital consulting all of which went to firms associated with the san antoniobased consultant brad parscale who served as digital director of mr trump s 2016 campaign and who is now advising a nonprofit group seeking to raise huge sums of cash to boost mr trump s legislative agenda mr parscale and the trump campaign data operation have attracted the interest of congressional investigators looking into the trump campaign s digital operation in connection with the russia investigations on friday mr parscale posted on twitter that he had accepted an invitation to appear before the house intelligence committee writing i am unaware of any russian involvement in the digital and data operation of the 2016 trump presidential campaign mr parscale s firms were by far the highestpaid vendors on the trump committee s payrolls and those payments seem to indicate that mr trump s reelection operation will again rely heavily on social media and other digital targeting of voters which is credited with helping to harness grassroots support for his candidacy to that end the reports also show that the committees spent nearly 500000 on data management services in the second quarter the reports filed saturday also show that the committees spent nearly 200000 on trumpbranded merchandise including more

members of the trump campaign team dmitri s peskov the spokesman for president vladimir v putin of russia told reporters that the kremlin had never heard of her asked about possible links between ms veselnitskaya and the foreign ministry maria zakharova the ministry s spokeswoman said that it had nothing to do with her efforts but in russia lines between career loyalty and government service tend to blur more than in other countries ms veselnitskaya built her career in the sharpelbowed struggle for land as the moscow suburbs expanded as once derelict factory sites and other plots became wildly valuable with the spread of shopping centers and new highways and she forged an important connection to the katsyv family william browder an americanborn hedge fund manager who has tussled repeatedly

years she had become the public face of moscow s efforts to reverse international travel and financial sanctions on key russian figures linked to an alleged 230 million tax fraud sergei magnitsky a lawyer who exposed the fraud was arrested by the same prosecutors who he suggested had organized it he died in jail in 2009 amid accusations of beatings and medical malpractice in 2012 mr browder who

their interests so long as they toe the kremlin line ms veselnitskaya lawyers and others who have followed her career said was well versed in this game and wielded its weapons in the mad dash for real estate profits in the moscow region that often pitted factions of current and former regional officials against one another in one instance a small nonprofit spravedlivost that tried to expose corruption in the moscow region published a series of articles accusing a group that included ms veselnitskaya her former husband aleksandr mitusov and mr katsyv of being corporate raiders who used

in birddogging senators i worked with one of our ace congressional correspondents thomas kaplan who honed his skills prying secrets out of the new york state legislature we deployed two interns emily cochrane and avantika chilkoti to help track the fastmoving events the senate vote occurred at 130 am on friday and lasted about 15 minutes it was strange to watch such riveting drama in the middle of the night but it was speedy compared with the allnighter in november 2003 when the house approved a bill adding prescription drug benefits to medicare that vote started at 3 am and lasted nearly three hours as republican leaders quashed an uprising by committed conservatives in 2009 and 2010 president barack obama and congressional democrats basically knew what they wanted a government guarantee of health insurance for all americans they disagreed on some important details but democrats had much more consensus than today s republicans the differences between president trump and mr obama are obvious mr trump floated above the gritty details of health policy and took occasional jabs at republicans slaving over the issue mr obama immersed himself in the details and his top aides occasionally reached out to journalists to provide tarttongued tutorials on the politics of health care in some ways the collapse of republican efforts to uproot the affordable care act recalled the last days of the clinton care effort to remake the american health care system it appeared to be moribund but its champions vowed to keep trying it finally expired on the senate floor in 1994 that defeat inspired democrats to try again 15 years later the four rounds of health care legislating have one thing in common the passion that surrounds the issue cancer survivors children with disabilities and young adults with diseases converged on congress in a bid to save the affordable care act lawmakers listening to their stories were clearly moved i had never heard members of congress speak with such empathy on behalf of medicaid beneficiaries or drug addicts whose treatment was financed by medicaid but for every such testimonial republicans could cite reports from constituents aggrieved by the law people who said they were spending more on health insurance premiums than on home mortgage payments and victims of obamacare who could not afford to use their insurance because the deductibles were so high advertisement continue reading the main story the lawmakers were in a sense deciding who would live and who would die but they had alternate versions of reality that could simply not be reconciled

here is a selection of comments which have been edited for length and clarity the pentagon papers this is not to trump jr s credit at least he didn t decline to release by asserting the emails were about yoga and a wedding the pentagon papers this is not wilbur clark canada i m at a loss for words this is a direct admission of collusion trump jr was told this is part of russia and its government s support for mr trump at this point anybody defending trump is doing so in the face of actual written admissions of guilt by those around him i m not even sure what remains to be argued anymore it s all here i m at a loss for words matthew sussis chicago another nothing burger this article is another nothing burger collusion means a quid pro quo there is no evidence trump jr received information remotely usable against hillary there is no evidence or suggestion that jr promised anything to the russians if such damaging information were forthcoming and the story makes clear the probable russian goal for the meeting was discussion of the magnitsky act you can assume otherwise but assumptions alone get you nowhere so nope still zero evidence of collusion hurryharry new jersey this is an american issue this is not a democratic or republican issue this is an american issue no one should be okay with a foreign government interfering in our elections i don t understand how the republican congress can continue to remain silent on this advertisement continue reading the main story sammy florida grossly disproportionate emphasis on russia so trump jr met with an attorney who was russian to get dirt on hillary no dirt was provided i fail to see why this is newsworthy don t politicians in election campaigns seek dirt on each other all the time are we supposed to get all excited because the source of information or rather the source of no information at all was russian i think trump is a terrible president but this whole russia angle that the press has been harping on forever just gets in the way of the real issues such as trump s catastrophic position on global warming the emphasis on russia is grossly disproportionate to its importance which is nil yaddayaddayadda the country and world cannot take much more hopefully this new information will serve to hasten the end of the mueller investigation i lived through the 60 s protests watergate and the

about wrongful acts by the clinton camp if there was such information trump jr would have been bound to take it to the fbi there was nothing but a plea to repeal an act of congress which is an entirely legal process under the constitution trump jr listened and quickly terminated the meeting the russians sought to influence us policy it did not work kudos to trump jr lwnieman cedarburg wis

from this woman is immaterial advertisement continue reading the main story the russians now know that he can be bought or influenced so much for trump senior s oftmentioned claim that having billions make you immune to outside pressure and bribery jtbence las vegas trump cut it short end of story so here s the chain some singer whose father is in real estate said something to a tabloid reporterentertainment lawyer then the lawyer said something to mr trump then there was a meeting in which it became clear that the woman who wanted the meeting was using the fictitious information damaging to hillary to meet with trump about a completely different topic then trump cut it short and end of story elfego new york grasping at anything that could help them win if absolutely nothing else this meeting shows that the trump campaign did grasp at anything that could help them win with the involvement of a foreign hostile government barely registering as even a minor concern if no further evidence comes to light of collusion between trump s campaign and russia it would be a reasonable assumption to think that someone came to their senses and tried to conceal it roshanina ghosh united kingdom an insane conspiracy theory this is madness this whole russia election conspiracy has been an insane conspiracy theory from the getgo one brief email exchange from somebody offering opposition research in the middle of a presidential campaign and the left is indulging their sick fetish of accusing the current administration of treason and coming up with melodramatic ultimatums when does the madness end why not cooperate with russia over certain issues they re not the soviet union richie mclaughlin on the times s facebook page you should be extremely worried i find it quite disturbing that the american public doesn t seem to be too concerned about the russians meddling in your democratic process and having a president who is clearly vulnerable to russian influence we europeans know mr putin and we also know how russia plays the game when trump was elected it was obvious to everyone that putin would run rings around him i think most people assumed that once he became president mr trump would be surrounded by an army of experienced officials that would somehow compensate for the lack of political savvy and diplomatic experience little did we know you should be extremely worried that your inexperienced and overconfident joke of a president is isolating your country from old allies and rolling out the red carpet for hostile foreign influence kalle

just listen to trump himself it s very sad that republicans he wrote in a weekend twitter rant do very little to protect their president in a historical sense he is right members of congress usually support a new president of their own party much more strongly than republicans are now they typically understand that a young presidency offers the rare opportunity for sweeping legislation like the reagan tax cut the george w bush tax cut the clinton deficit plan and the obama stimulus health bill and financial regulation some intraparty tensions are unavoidable and defectors kill some legislation as happened with the clinton health plan and the obama climate plan but partisan loyalty is the norm newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the opinion today newsletter every weekday get thoughtprovoking commentary from oped columnists the times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york timess products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters congress members tend to echo white house talking points fulsomely they find the votes to pass bills they defend the president against scandal and the loyalty doesn t stop in the first year during watergate as the political scientist jonathan bernstein has noted most republicans stood by richard nixon until almost the bitter end matt glassman another political scientist is one of the sharper observers of the white housecongress relationship and i asked him to put the current situation in context glassman said that many progressives have made the mistake of comparing how they want congress to treat trump with what it is doing the more relevant yardstick is how congress s treatment compares historically the current congressional gop seems less supportive and more constraining of the potus than basically any in history glassman wrote to me save the unique circumstances of andrew johnson who wasn t really a republican and john tyler who bucked his party aggressively neither of whom were elected many of today s republicans avoid going on television as trump surrogates they mock him off the record and increasingly on the record too in recent weeks eight senators have publicly stood in the way of a health care bill republican senators are also helping to conduct an investigation of trump s campaign and have backed the appointment of robert mueller as special counsel one reason is that they don t fear trump about 90 percent of republican house members won a larger vote share in their district last year than trump did according to sarah binder of george washington university since he took office trump s nationwide net approval rating has fallen to minus 16 with only 39 percent approving from plus 4 advertisement continue reading the main story so it s not just republican politicians who are inching away from trump republican voters are too none of this is meant to suggest that congressional republicans have been profiles in courage they haven t been they have mostly stood by as trump has lied compulsively denigrated the rule of law and tried to shred the modern safety net but they have put up just enough resistance to keep him from doing far more damage than he otherwise would have in the months ahead unfortunately that level of resistance is unlikely to be sufficient trump has made clear that he isn t finished trying to take health insurance away from millions of people or trying to hide the truth about his russia ties the constitutional crisis won t be if trump fires mueller as the aclu s kate oh put it the constitutional crisis is if congress takes no real action in response for now anxious optimism or maybe optimistic anxiety seems the appropriate attitude

kazuyoshi umemoto japan s chief negotiator told reporters that the group of 11 achieved mutual understanding on a path forward without the united states we need a new international agreement mr umemoto said i think we have reached a rough picture of what it will be like momentum for such deals has built in recent weeks as big american allies have pledged their commitment to globalization on the eve of the group of 20 summit meeting in hamburg germany last week japan and the european union announced the outlines of a broad agreement that would create a trading bloc encompassing 20 trillion in combined economic output the deal was announced as the united states appeared increasingly isolated on issues like free trade and the environment president trump has repeatedly made clear his antipathy toward free trade vowing to protect american workers and rebalance trade deficits with other countries on wednesday the united states trade representative robert e lighthizer sent a letter to the south korean government saying that the administration was eager to revise a trade agreement between the two countries that has been in force for five years if japan and the 10 other signatories are to keep the tpp alive they would need at the very least to revise a clause that says the deal will come into effect only when ratified by six countries representing 85 percent of the combined economic value of the 12 original members without the united states that threshold cannot be reached japan which has the largest economy among the remaining trade partners is pushing to preserve most of the ambitious rules that negotiators originally hammered out as are australia and new zealand advertisement continue reading the main story the hope of course of japan is to maintain the status quo of the already agreed framework including the details said tomohiko taniguchi a foreign policy adviser to prime minister shinzo abe while optimistic that japan could lead the group toward consensus mr taniguchi who referred to the remaining tpp countries as the ocean s 11 acknowledged that the discussions would be challenging negotiations once started could turn in all sorts of different directions he said it s a gathering of 11 after all selfcentered even selfish countries all sorts of negotiations are likely happening developing countries such as malaysia and vietnam may want to renegotiate some of the tougher requirements that they accepted in exchange for the promise of access to american markets the agreement for example requires developing nations to reform childlabor laws as well as to improve the transparency of stateowned companies and it permits drug makers in the large economies to extend patent protection on many pharmaceuticals that the smaller countries want to manufacture some of the developing countries may protest that such requirements are too onerous without the incentive of being able to export to american consumers newsletter sign up

problem is when you take the united states out the united states is twothirds of the tpp said jeffrey wilson a research fellow at the perth usasia center at the university of western australia for developing countries being asked to make expensive overhauls mr wilson said what is the point of the deal anymore japan s goal is to preserve as much of the original deal as possible in the hope that the united states will eventually rejoin we should welcome the united states when the united states decides to come back at some time in the future said ichiro fujisaki a former japanese ambassador to washington some observers see those hopes as na√Øve i think it s simply wishful thinking that the trump administration will change its mind about the tpp said takuji okubo managing director and chief economist at japan macro advisors so long as he remains the president i don t think he will actually make that turnaround advertisement continue reading the main story others suggested that advisers to mr trump might try to change his mind once he sees how difficult it can be to negotiate bilateral trade agreements but in that case they say the 11 remaining countries should not alter the tpp if they try to renegotiate the rules or lower the standards it will make it harder for the us to rejoin the agreement down the road said bruce h andrews deputy secretary of the commerce department in the obama administration and now a managing director at rock creek global advisors a consulting firm and there is another reason the tpp countries should maintain the tough trade rules mr andrews said to push china toward reform if tpp had gone into force the chinese by necessity would eventually have wanted to be part of it to enjoy its benefits mr andrews said in order to get into tpp china would have had to do some serious economic reform and open their market from their current closed state if tpp does not go forward as the model china will likely get better terms from other countries without having to open its market in japan mr abe has his own political reasons for wanting to push ahead with the tpp mr abe expended considerable political capital for the deal going up against farmers who have traditionally supported his liberal democratic party the agreement would require japan s closed agricultural sector to accept imports of rice pork and other products mr abe has also recently been dogged by influencepeddling scandals and his party suffered a resounding defeat in a recent local election in tokyo by agreeing to the trade deal with the european union last week he was able to score a quick victory i think it s important to keep that momentum said jun saito a senior research fellow at the japan center for economic research japan has indicated that it wants to secure an agreement between the remaining 11 countries in the transpacific partnership by november when many of them will gather at a summit meeting in vietnam most analysts say any agreement is unlikely to be completed that quickly still said shumpei takemori a professor of economics at keio university the reopening of negotiations allows japan and its allies to show the us administration that we have alternatives

to me the answer to mr trump s question begins with a straightforward test was the person to whom a monument is erected on public property devoted to the american experiment in liberty and selfgovernment washington and jefferson and andrew jackson were each owned slaves each was largely a creature of his time and place on matters of race yet each also believed in the transcendent significance of the nation and each was committed to the journey toward a more perfect union newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the opinion today newsletter every weekday get thoughtprovoking commentary from oped columnists the times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york timess products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters by definition the confederate hierarchy fails that test those who took up arms against the union were explicitly attempting to stop the american odyssey while we should judge each individual on the totality of their lives defenders of lee for instance point to his attempts to be a figure of reconciliation after the war the forces of hate and of exclusion long ago made confederate imagery their own monuments in public places of veneration to those who believed it their duty to fight the union have no place in the union of the 21st century a view with which lee himself might have agreed i think it wiser he wrote in 1866 not to keep open the sores of war of course lee lost that struggle too and my home state is dealing with just this issue at the moment in 1973 the sons of confederate veterans raised money to install a bust of nathan bedford forrest the southern cavalry commander and early leader of the klan in the state capitol it s ahistoric to judge figures from the past by our own moral standards yet we need not contort ourselves to find forrest wanting as an object of veneration he was condemned for outrages and atrocities in his own time one example the massacre at fort pillow in april 1864 in western tennessee where forrest s men cruelly butchered every colored soldier they could lay hands upon according to a report in the chicago tribune not long after more than a century and a half on the battle over forrest s memory here may offer lessons for others taken as a whole my state was always ambivalent about the confederacy in february 1861 a majority of its voters opposed a proposed secession convention with prounion sentiment particularly strong in the more mountainous eastern region of the state then came fort sumter and the federal call to fight the secessionists and secession carried the day at last by the end of the war 120000 tennesseans had fought for the confederacy but a significant number 31000 took up arms for the union as historians have noted that meant tennessee alone provided the federal forces with more soldiers than all other seceded states combined given its history during the confederate era then tennessee has the capacity to be more reasonable in the neoconfederate one according to a 2016 law the removal of a monument like the one to forrest requires either an act of the general assembly or a twothirds vote of the state s historical commission most of whom are appointed by the governor and the position of gov bill haslam a popular republican is clear it s time for the forrest bust to go i don t believe nathan bedford forrest should be one of the individuals we honor at the capitol he said that history should be put in a museum not in a place of honor there will never be peace in tennessee union gen william t sherman once said until forrest is dead like his more celebrated remark that war is hell sherman was onto something the good news in this grim period of 2017 is that reasonable southerners may be ready to give peace a chance

pakistani officials in turn have cited indian influence as a primary cause of instability and insecurity in afghanistan officials in islamabad accuse india of supporting a hostile political regime in kabul and funding militants who use afghanistan as a base to launch attacks inside pakistan even before mr trump unveiled his strategy on monday islamabad was apprehensive and concerned the pakistani military has been at the forefront of formulating the country s foreign policy and has taken the lead in defining the contours of islamabad s relationship with afghanistan and india the civilian government has very little say if any in these policy initiatives pakistani officials said they expected private contractors to take a more dominant role than troops already in afghanistan senior pakistani security officials stress that an allinclusive engagement is the only option for peace inside afghanistan more troops inside the country along with blaming pakistan for harboring terrorists will not work they said in background interviews however there was no formal official response to mr trump s speech by tuesday evening pakistan s foreign minister khawaja muhammad asif is to leave for the united states in the next few days to hold talks with american officials a spokesman said the military also decided not to put forth a formal public response in what could be viewed as a preemptive move major gen asif ghafoor the military spokesman had said in a press briefing earlier on monday that no terror group was operating inside pakistan sehar kamran an opposition senator who leads an islamabadbased think tank said mr trump s plan appeared to be more of the same under much more colorful language and contradictory bluster the shift from a timelineoriented approach to a conditionbased one i think is only the vocalization of a longstanding practice she said adding what is concerning for pakistan however is the contradiction within his statement that expresses both an acknowledgment of the country s sacrifices while simultaneously downplaying them by continuing accusations of sheltering terrorists and doing not enough with billions and billions paid by america

newsletters ms kamran said that pushing india to play a stronger role inside afghanistan would isolate washington s friends in islamabad without realizing understanding or perhaps deliberately underestimating the impact of increasing indian presence on pakistan s western border advertisement continue reading the main story an unnecessary flexing of military muscles and the deployment of additional troops at this time will only undo much that has been achieved over many years diplomatically and serve to further antagonize regional countries like pakistan china and russia she said analysts said pakistan s dependence on american aid had declined in recent years partly as china flexes its military might in south asia giving policy makers in islamabad more room to maneuver pakistan is prepared to absorb the impact of a more assertive us policy toward the country said arif rafiq a nonresident fellow at the middle east institute in washington it s the most economically stable that it s been in a decade thanks in part to massive chinese investment and it has managed to secure much of its border regions despite the withdrawal of most us combat forces mr rafiq said that pakistan also knows that it has several options to counter punitive actions by washington including closing supply routes to afghanistan i think what pakistan hopes for is the us to engage it as a partner in afghanistan rather than as a contractor deputed to arrest or kill insurgent leaders named by washington mr rafiq said that requires coordination on border security and a structured dialogue process with the taliban i think islamabad will remain rather firm in steering its engagement with both kabul and washington in that direction other analysts offered an even more scathing view of mr trump s speech by inviting india to be more active in afghanistan trump has confirmed the worst fears of pakistan s generals that america is in cahoots with india against pakistan said mosharraf zaidi a foreignpolicy analyst in islamabad there may never be a perfect approach to convince pakistan to abandon the haqqani network but this speech was a terrible attempt mr zaidi said referring to the pakistanbased militant group that has been blamed for most of the deadly attacks inside afghanistan however maria sultan a defense analyst based in islamabad and director general of the south asian strategic stability institute said the trump policy was not as bad as we were expecting the responsibility has been essentially shifted to afghanistan she warned that intelligencebased operations against groups inside pakistan might increase this will further reduce the space for cooperation between pakistan and us and will be counterproductive for a longterm relationship ms sultan

a white house official said there was nothing unusual about it and in two tweets late tuesday mr trump derided news reports about it as sick he said the dinner was not a secret since all of the world leaders at the summit meeting and their spouses had been invited by chancellor angela merkel of germany press knew he tweeted even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in germany is made to look sinister mr trump added while the leadersandspouses dinner was on mr trump s public schedule the news media was not allowed to witness any part of it nor were reporters provided with an account of what transpired mr trump s traveling press contingent did note however that his motorcade left the dinner four minutes after mr putin s did the dinner at which the private conversation took place stretched for more than three hours after a concert for the leaders and their spouses at the elbphilharmonie a concert hall on the banks of the elbe river in the earlier formal meeting mr trump said later he asked the russian president twice about his role in the american vote mr putin denied involvement and the two men agreed to move beyond the dispute in the interest of finding common ground on other matters including a limited ceasefire in syria there is no official united states government record of the intimate dinner conversation because no american official other than the president was involved pretty much everyone at the dinner thought this was really weird that here is the president of the united states who clearly wants to display that he has a better relationship personally with president putin than any of us or simply doesn t care said ian bremmer president of the eurasia group a new yorkbased research and consulting firm who said he had heard directly from attendees they were flummoxed they were confused and they were startled advertisement continue reading the main story the encounter occurred more than midway through the lengthy dinner when mr trump left his chair and approached mr putin who had been seated next to the first lady melania trump it was described to mr bremmer by other guests as lasting roughly an hour and not initially disputed by a white house official who spoke on the condition of anonymity but sean spicer the white house press secretary disputed that account he said mr trump had described the exchange with mr putin as purely social and as lasting far less than an hour it was pleasantries and small talk mr spicer said in a separate statement the white house said the two presidents had spoken through the kremlin s interpreter because the american translator with mr trump did not speak russian experts in united statesrussia relations said such an encounter even on an informal basis at a social event was a concern because of its length

independent american account of what happened said steven pifer a former ambassador to ukraine who also specializes in russia and nuclear arms control if i was in the kremlin my recommendation to putin would be see if you can get this guy alone and that s what it sounds like he was able to do added mr pifer a senior fellow at the brookings institution in washington the trump administration is struggling to improve its relationship with russia while under pressure from multiple investigations into possible ties between mr trump s campaign and moscow those inquiries have cast a shadow over what would normally be seen as an attempt at diplomacy between world leaders the evening after his two meetings with mr putin the first lasting 135 minutes and the second an hour mr trump returned to washington on the air force one flight back his top advisers helped draft a statement about a meeting his son donald trump jr attended last year with a kremlinconnected lawyer who promised damaging information about hillary clinton we have the worst relationship as a country right now with russia that we have in decades and yet we have these two leaders that for reasons that do not make sense

the americans that there must be an unconditional return of the property or moscow would retaliate the state department said no such agreement was in store video these deals so to speak are going to take some time heather nauert the state department spokeswoman told reporters on tuesday nothing is coming together anytime soon mr trump announced on tuesday night that he planned to nominate jon m huntsman jr a former envoy to china and singapore as his ambassador to russia mr huntsman s nomination has been expected for months but the investigations into mr trump s campaign and whether it colluded with russia are likely to figure prominently in his confirmation hearing

the appointees include lawyers who have represented businesses in cases against government regulators staff members of political dark money groups employees of industryfunded organizations opposed to environmental rules and at least three people who were registered to lobby the agencies they now work for at the education department alone two members of the deregulation team were most recently employed by procharter advocacy groups or operators and one appointee was an executive handling regulatory issues at a forprofit college operator so far the process has been scattershot some agencies have been soliciting public feedback while others refuse even to disclose who is in charge of the review in many cases responses to public records requests have been denied delayed or severely redacted photo the interior department has not disclosed the correspondence or calendars for its team but a review of more than 1300 pages of handwritten signin sheets for guests visiting the agency s headquarters in washington found that appointees had met regularly with industry representatives over a fourmonth period from february through may at least 58 representatives of the oil and gas industry signed their names on the agency s visitor logs before meeting with appointees the environmental protection agency also rejected requests to release the appointment calendar of the official leading its team a former top executive for an industryfunded political group even as she met privately with industry representatives and the defense department and the department of homeland security provided the titles for most appointees to their review teams but not names advertisement continue reading the main story when asked for comment about the activities of the deregulation teams the white house referred reporters to the office of management and budget meghan burris a spokeswoman there said as previous administrations have recognized it s good government to periodically reassess existing regulations past regulatory review efforts however have not taken a consistent enough look at regulations on the books with billions of dollars at stake in the push to deregulate corporations and other industry groups are hiring lawyers lobbyists and economists to help navigate this new avenue for influence getting to the front of the line is crucial as it can take years to effect regulatory changes competition will be fierce the law firm clark hill which represents businesses pitching the epa said in a marketing memo in all likelihood interested parties will need to develop a multipronged strategy to expand support and win preeminence over competing regulatory rollback candidates jane luxton a lawyer at the firm said she advised clients to pay for economic and legal analyses that government agencies short on staff could use to expedite changes she declined to identify the clients you may say this is an agency s job but the agencies are totally overloaded ms luxton said meeting behind closed doors on a cloudy humid day in march laura peterson a top lobbyist for syngenta arrived at the headquarters for the interior department she looped the letter l across the agency s signin sheet her company a top pesticide maker based in switzerland had spent eight years and millions of dollars lobbying the obama administration on environmental rules with limited success advertisement continue reading the main story but ms peterson had an in with the new administration scott cameron newly installed at the interior department and a member of its deregulation team had just left a nonprofit he founded he had advocated getting pesticides approved and out to market faster his group counted syngenta as a financial partner the meeting with ms peterson was one of the first mr cameron took as a new government official neither side would reveal what was discussed i m not sure that s reporting information i have to give you ms peterson said but lobbying records offered clues syngenta has been one of several pesticide manufacturers pushing for changes to the endangered species act when federal agencies take actions that may jeopardize endangered animals or plants they are generally supposed to consult with the interior department which could raise objections for decades the epa largely ignored this provision when approving new pesticides but recently a legal challenge from environmental groups forced its hand a change that affected syngenta this article was produced in collaboration with propublica an independent nonprofit investigative journalism organization pesticide lobbyists have been working behind the scenes at agencies and on capitol hill to change the provision companies have argued that they should be exempt from consulting with the interior department because they already undergo epa approval along with spending millions of dollars on lobbying they have funded advocacy groups aligned with their cause mr cameron s nonprofit the reduce risks from invasive species coalition was one such group for syngenta the organization says on its website that its goals include reducing the regulatory burden of the endangered species act on american society by addressing invasive species one way to do that is to use pesticides the nonprofit s mission includes creating business opportunities for commercial products and services used to control invasive species because donations are not publicly reported it is unclear how much syngenta has contributed to mr cameron s organization but his group has called the pesticide company one of its generous sponsors advertisement continue reading the main story mr cameron also served on a committee of experts and stakeholders including syngenta that advised the federal government on decisions related to invasive species at a committee event last july he said that one of his priorities was getting biocontrol agents to market faster according to meeting minutes paul minehart a syngenta spokesman said employees regularly engage with those in government that relate to agriculture and our business our purpose is to balance serving the public health and environment with enabling farmers access to innovation a spokeswoman for the interior department did not respond to questions about how mr cameron s relationship with syngenta might influence his review of regulations a minefield of conflicts under the law members of the trump administration can seek ethics waivers to work on issues that overlap with their past business careers they can also formally recuse themselves when potential conflicts arise in many cases the administration has refused to say whether appointees to mr trump s deregulation teams have done either one such appointee is samantha dravis the chairwoman of the deregulation team at the epa who was a top official at the republican attorneys general association ms dravis was also president of the rule of law defense fund which brought together energy companies and republican attorneys general to file lawsuits against the federal government over obamaera environmental regulations the republican association s work has been criticized as a vehicle for corporate donors to gain the credibility and expertise of state attorneys general in fighting federal regulations donors include the american petroleum institute the energy company conocophillips and the coal giant alpha natural resources the republican association also received funding from freedom partners backed by the conservative billionaires charles g and david h koch ms dravis worked for that group as well which recently identified regulations it wants eliminated among them are epa rules relating to cleanwater protections and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions advertisement continue reading the main story liz bowman an epa spokeswoman declined to say whether ms dravis had recused herself from issues dealing with previous employers

cleanenergy advocates fear the inquiry will cast solar energy which can fluctuate as a threat to grid reliability such a finding could scare off state public utility commissions considering solar policies and serve as a boon for electrical utilities said matt kasper research director at the energy and policy institute an environmental group disclosure records show that while mr mccormack was at edison the trade group lobbied the federal government including the energy department on issues including grid reliability photo the department would not answer questions about mr mccormack s involvement with those issues across the government at least two appointees to deregulation teams have been granted waivers from ethics rules related to prior jobs and at least nine others have pledged to recuse themselves from issues related to former employers or clients some of the recusals involve appointees at the small business administration and the education department including bob eitel who leads the education team and was vice president for regulatory legal services at an operator of forprofit colleges another recusal involves byron brown an epa appointee who is married to a senior government affairs manager for the hess corporation the oil and gas company hess was fined and ordered to spend more than 45 million on pollution controls by the epa during the obama administration because of alleged clean air act violations at its refinery in port reading nj disclosure records show that mr brown s wife lesley schaaff lobbied the epa last year on behalf of the

educators and environmental activists approached the microphone and urged government officials not to weaken regulations intended to protect children from lead the forum run by the epa in a drab basement meeting room in washington was part of the agency s push to identify regulations that were excessive and burdensome to businesses few businesspeople showed up as public hearings on regulations have played out in recent weeks many industry and corporate representatives have instead met with trump administration officials behind closed doors still the epa has asked for written comments and held about a dozen public meetings the agency has received more than 467000 comments many of them critical of potential rollbacks but also some from businesses large and small pleading for relief from regulatory costs or confusion advertisement continue reading the main story after a quiet moment at the meeting to discuss lead regulations the owner of a local painting company brian mccracken moved to the microphone mr mccracken was frustrated by what he described as costly rules that forced him to test for leadbased paint in homes before he could begin painting each test kit costs about 2 and he may need six per room if a family then declines to hire him those costs come out of his pocket i don t think anyone is sitting here saying that leadbased dust does not hurt children he said that s not what we are talking about what the contractor needs is a better way to test photo his voice quavered why do i have to educate the general public about the hazards that generations before me created it doesn t make sense at all mr trump is not the first president to take on such frustrations president bill clinton declared that the federal government was failing to regulate without imposing unacceptable or unreasonable costs on society he assigned vice president al gore to collect agencies suggestions for rules that should go one rule dictated how to measure the consistency of grits president george w bush s regulatory overhaul focused more on how new regulations were created the administration installed a political appointee inside each agency who generally had to sign off before any significant new rule could be initiated at the epa for a time that official came from an industryfunded think tank president barack obama ordered regular updates from each agency about the effectiveness of rules already on the books when you raise the profile when it s clearly an executive priority it gets attention said heather krause director of strategic issues at the government accountability office the main auditor of the federal government according to the auditor s analysis the effect under mr obama was mostly to clarify and streamline rules not eliminate them advertisement continue reading the main story like mr bush mr trump has empowered political appointees though some agencies have included career staff members on their review teams an executive order from mr trump creating the teams does not require it nonpolitical employees are generally believed to be more wedded to existing rules and like mr obama mr trump has imposed regular reporting requirements but mr trump who spent his business career on the other side of government regulations has put an emphasis on cutting old rules the same day he signed the executive order initiating the review he addressed a large crowd of conservative activists at a maryland convention center we have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy crushing mr trump said we re going to put the regulations industry out of work and out of business amit narang a regulatory expert at the liberal advocacy group public citizen said mr trump s decision to create teams of political appointees formally known as regulatory reform task forces should make it easier for the white house to overcome bureaucratic resistance to his rollback plans to the extent there s a deep

the classical greek concept of manliness emphasizes certain traits the bedrock virtue is courage the manly man puts himself on the line and risks death and criticism the manly man is assertive he does not hang back but instead wades into any fray the manly man is competitive he looks for ways to compete with others to demonstrate his prowess and to be the best the manly man is selfconfident he knows his own worth but he is also touchy he is outraged if others do not grant him the honor that is his due that version of manliness gave greece its dynamism but the greeks came to understand the problem with manly men they are hard to live with they are constantly picking fights and engaging in peacock displays newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the opinion today newsletter every weekday get thoughtprovoking commentary from oped columnists the times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york timess products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters take the savage feuding that marks the trump white house and put it on steroids and you get some idea of greek culture the greek tragedies describe cycles of revenge and counterrevenge as manly men and women wreak death and destruction on each other so the greeks took manliness to the next level on top of the honor code they gave us the concept of magnanimity pericles is the perfect magnanimous man and in america george washington and george marshall were his heirs the magnanimous leader possesses all the spirited traits described above but he uses his traits not just to puff himself up but to create a just political order the magnanimous man tries to master the profession of statecraft because he believes with the athenian ruler solon that the wellgoverned city makes all things wise and perfect in the world of men the magnanimous leader tries to beautify his city to arouse people s pride in and love for it he encourages citizens to get involved in great civic projects that will give their lives meaning and allow everybody to partake in the heroic action that was once reserved for the aristocratic few the magnanimous man has a certain style he is a bit aloof marked more by gravitas than familiarity he shows perfect selfcontrol because he has mastered his passions he does not show his vulnerability his relationships are not reciprocal he is eager to grant favors but is ashamed of receiving them his personal life can wither because he has devoted himself to disinterested public service the magnanimous man believes that politics practiced well is the noblest of all professions no other arena requires as much wisdom tenacity foresight and empathy no other field places such stress on conversation and persuasion the english word idiot comes from the ancient greek word for the person who is uninterested in politics but capable only of running his or her own private affairs advertisement continue reading the main story today we re in a crisis of masculinity some men are unable to compete in schools and in labor markets because the stereotype of what is considered man s work is so narrow in the white house we have phony manliness run amok but we still have all these older models to draw from of all the politicians i ve covered john mccain comes closest to the old magnanimous ideal last week when he went to the senate and flipped his thumb down on the pretzeledup health care bill we saw one version of manliness trumping another when john kelly elbowed out anthony scaramucci one version of manliness replaced another the old virtues aren t totally lost so there s hope

they then employed a cover story adoptions to make it believable to the outside world that there was nothing amiss with the proposed meetings they bolstered this idea by using cutouts nonofficial

relationship they knew what bait to use and had a plan to reel in the fish once it bit while we don t know for sure whether the email solicitation was part of an intelligence ploy there are some clues a month after the june meeting at trump tower wikileaks a veritable russian front released a dump of stolen dnc emails the candidate and campaign surrogates increasingly mouthed talking points that seemed taken directly from russian propaganda outlets such as that there had been a terrorist attack on a turkish military base when no such attack had occurred also at this time united states intelligence reportedly received indications from european intelligence counterparts about odd meetings between russians and trump campaign representatives overseas of course to determine whether collusion occurred we would have to know whether the trump campaign continued to meet with russian representatives subsequent to the june meeting the early courting stage is almost always somewhat open and discoverable only after the russian intelligence officer develops a level of control can the relationship be moved out of the public eye john brennan the former director of the cia recently testified frequently people who go along a treasonous path do not know they are on a treasonous path until it is too late even intelligence professionals who respect one another and who understand the russians can and often do disagree on the trump collusion question the difference of opinion comes down to this would the russians use someone like mr goldstone to approach the trump campaign our friend and former colleague daniel hoffman argued in this paper that this is unlikely that the russians would have relied on trained agents we respectfully disagree we believe that the russians might well have used mr goldstone we also believe the russians would have seen very little downside to trying to recruit someone on the trump team a big fish if the fish bit and they were able to reel it in the email from mr goldstone could remain hidden and since it was from an acquaintance would be deniable if found exactly what the trump team is doing now if the fish didn t take the bait the russians would always have had the option to weaponize the information later to embarrass the trump team in addition if the russians first objective was chaos and disruption the best way to accomplish that would have been to have someone on the inside helping it is unlikely that the russians would not use all the traditional espionage tools available to them however perhaps the most telling piece of information may be the most obvious donald trump himself made numerous statements in support of russia russian intelligence and wikileaks during the campaign at the same time mr trump and his team have gone out of their way to hide contacts with russians and lied to the public about it likewise mr trump has attacked those people and institutions that could get to the bottom of the affair he fired his fbi director james comey criticized and bullied his attorney general and deputy attorney general denigrated the fbi and the cia and assails the news media labeling anything he dislikes fake news innocent people don t tend to behave this way the overall russian intent is clear disruption of the united states political system and society a goal that in the russian view was best served by a trump presidency what remains to be determined is whether the russians also attempted to suborn members of the trump team in an effort to gain their cooperation this is why the investigation by the special counsel robert mueller is so important it is why the fbi counterintelligence investigation also quietly progressing in the background is critical because while a russian disruption operation is certainly plausible it is not inconsistent with a much darker russian goal gaining an insider ally at the highest levels of the united states government advertisement continue reading the main

mr trump borrowed conservatives lingo on tuesday saying the altleft bore responsibility using a phrase popular with commentators like fox s sean hannity they think there were 300 or so racists who showed up to a rally and who got exactly what they wanted violence and violence in a way that inspires the nation s elite to double down on iconoclasm in a way they hope grows their movement said ben domenech the publisher of the federalist an online magazine a headline on the federalist on monday summed up that sentiment white supremacists were not the only thugs tearing up charlottesville a site called the patriot post created a meme called they lie using two juxtaposed photographs the first was a man looking at mr trump waving to a sea of cheering fans the second was a picture of that same

recent episodes as evidence of the left gone mad they include the comedian kathy griffin s posing for a picture with a fake severed trump head and a production of shakespeare s julius caesar that featured a trumplike actor as the emperor who is fatally stabbed onstage some seized on the shooting that seriously injured representative steve scalise republican of louisiana at a congressional baseball team practice in june as further proof one recent web video from the national rifle association accused liberals of attempting to bully and terrorize the law abiding as it implored americans to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth but the tragedy in charlottesville specifically the death of a young woman at the hands of a nazi sympathizer who the authorities said ran her down with his car undercut the notion that the blackmasked radical leftists who smash windows and hurl firebombs are an equal menace advertisement continue reading the main story nor is it backed up by data on political violence of at least 372 murders that were committed by domestic extremists between 2007 and 2016 according to a study by the antidefamation league 74 percent were committed by rightwing extremists muslim extremists were responsible for 24 percent of those killings and the small remainder were committed by leftwing extremists the study concluded noah rothman an editor for commentary magazine a conservative opinion journal said the emphasis for many conservatives is not on statistics that indicate who is the more violent offender rather he said the point is about the general tenor of political debate which people like him believe is weighted against them you don t have a ton of reporters banging on the doors of democrats asking them to denounce antifa he said referring to the militant marxistinspired group that rioted at mr trump s inauguration and often shows up looking for confrontation at sites where conservative writers like ann coulter and milo yiannopoulos are scheduled to speak we re comparing a body count and that to me seems like it s the wrong place to start mr rothman added the place to start is when we have violence in the streets we need to have a conversation about where we are as a country mr trump is no mere bit player in the discussion of political violence at various times he has offered to pay the legal bills of supporters who get in brawls at his events and stated without offering any proof that paid agitators were responsible for protests against him mr trump s sympathizers generally amplify these claims including some who did after charlottesville alex jones the rightwing provocateur and sandy hook massacre denier whom mr trump once personally called to thank for his support said people who protested the white supremacists over the weekend were probably actors in an internet broadcast on saturday mr jones played down the significance of the violence saying it was likely staged by democratic party activists who are looking to overdemonize whites and put chips on the shoulders of the socalled minorities photo demographically blacks are 12 times more likely to attack whites for no reason mr jones went on providing no evidence for his claim it s a fact advertisement continue reading the main story he then recounted his own experience watching a nazi rally he said was attended by jews posing as nazis evident by their curly hair and you know dark eyes mike cernovich a conspiracy theory peddler was gleeful as he posted on twitter about the violence on saturday civil war is here he wrote like others on the far right he said the rhetoric on the left was to blame the left has preached hatred for decades those they hated began to hate them back how is anyone surprised by this mr cernovich headlined a rally for peace in washington after the scalise shooting a rally that quickly turned into a referendum on the left s culpability in the crime he also played a central role in the pizzagate hoax that attempted to link hillary clinton to a child sex ring and has been praised by mr trump s son donald trump jr as being worthy of a pulitzer prize there is also a new political term to describe the circular firing squad in which right and left have blamed the other for the country s degenerating political debate whataboutism guy benson a conservative writer and an author of the book end of discussion which argues that the left has tried to shut down political debate by declaring certain topics off the table said he sees a whataboutism overreach among some conservatives but on the other hand he said are we allowed to point out that leftwing violence is a problem and did probably contribute to what happened in charlottesville and not be compared to hitler he said that conservatives would be better served by finding other ways to make points of media bias and political double standards round and round we go with this oneupsmanship of who s worse mr benson added and that s a really terrible way to argue

despite nearly two decades of sour relations with venezuela the united states has enormous leverage as one of its most important customers and as one the few countries with refineries capable of processing poorquality heavy crude the maduro regime is already tottering struggling to meet its financial obligations feed its people and pay its oil workers soldiers and police officers additional american sanctions could be a devastating economic blow prompting the country to move further toward dictatorship and toward an even closer embrace of china and russia the result could be more violent strife or even a military coup and shock waves across the hemisphere could create more complications for the trump administration as it tries to focus on iran and north korea photo it s complicated said david l goldwyn who was a top state department energy envoy in the obama administration tough sanctions could lead to a default on their bonds and a collapse of internal investment and oil production he added other impacts could include civil unrest refugee flows across their borders and a cutoff of venezuelan financial support to cuba and haiti that could lead to migration flows to the united states there is also the potential for collateral damage to the united states any trade embargo could raise gasoline prices cost jobs in the oil patch and dampen profits for several major refiners a decrease in venezuelan exports could raise global oil prices bolstering the economies of russia and iran just as washington prepares to ratchet up sanctions on those countries in briefings administration officials would not speculate on what would come next but they emphasized a menu of options mr trump in a statement last week said the united states will not stand by as venezuela crumbles advertisement continue reading the main story the immediate concern is over mr maduro s plan to hold an election this weekend for a constituent assembly that would circumvent the

country s plummeting economy has added pressure on a region struggling with low commodity prices for now the united states is treading cautiously in its approach to venezuela as a first step the administration this week froze assets of and instituted a ban on travel visas for 13 influential venezuelans including electoral military and correctional officials one of them is sim√≥n zerpa vice president for finance at petr√≥leos de venezuela known as pdvsa which could complicate relations between the state oil company and american players in venezuela that are already struggling to get paid for services the move follows similar sanctions imposed by the trump administration on venezuela s vice president tareck el aissami and eight members of its supreme court mr maduro has repeatedly said that mr trump s past sanctions against his government are evidence of american imperialism and that current threats will not be heeded if mr trump has dared to say no to the constituent assembly we tell him yes yes yes the constituent assembly will go ahead constituent assembly now more than ever mr maduro said recently photo more consequential would be future sanctions to limit american oil companies and service companies from operating in venezuela or to limit the ability of the venezuelan national oil company to engage in banking activities in the united states or trade with american companies that scenario would effectively end venezuelan oil exports to the united states and prohibit pdvsa from importing the american light oil used to dilute its heavy crude for transport through pipelines and processing such moves at least in the short term could result in a collapse in production of the oil that venezuela depends on to get the foreign currency it needs to buy food and to service its debt it will put pdvsa on its knees and almost certainly lead to default said francisco j monaldi a venezuelan oil expert at rice university in houston depending on the details of future sanctions citgo wholly owned by the venezuelan state oil company could also be crippled citgo operates roughly 4 percent of american refining capacity as well as a sprawling network of pipelines and gasoline stations in the united states venezuela now sells more than 700000 barrels of oil a day to the united states out of a total production of roughly two million barrels a day or just over 2 percent of world production energy experts say venezuela could eventually replace the american market by exporting more heavy oil to china and india though at a discount and the 100000 barrels a day of light oil it imports from the united states could be replaced by imports from nigeria and algeria advertisement continue reading the main story venezuela would have to move quickly it faces big bond payments later this year and its foreign reserves are dwindling they have shown that they can get along so i m not sure suspending the purchasing of 700000 barrels will crack the government said

cutoff of venezuelan oil imports would force chevron valero energy phillips 66 and other refiners to replace the heavy crude with imports from places like kuwait and saudi arabia producing higher tanker costs the administration could sell the refiners supplies from the strategic petroleum reserve to help cushion the blow to their profit margins in the short term it s going to be very disruptive said chet m thompson president of the american fuel petrochemical manufacturers a trade group that has been lobbying against sanctions that would disrupt venezuelan oil imports you are

i don t think that i as an individual could have swayed the election in a meaningful way but i know i could have done so much more and i did not i hold myself accountable for that i am increasingly concerned with accountability because our country is being led by a man who believes he is accountable only to himself and enriching his coffers rather than the more than 300 million people he was so narrowly elected to lead and serve it pains me to think about what could have been it is even more difficult to face the way things are every single morning i am tense as i check the news wondering

over the past seven months is far more terrible than i could have imagined advances made during the obama era are being dismantled i tell myself to remain hopeful but struggle to find a reason and then i struggle to remind myself that despair is a luxury we cannot afford right now a week ago in charlottesville va white men assembled to rage for a world long lost one where their mediocrity was good enough these were men emboldened by a president who shares their odious beliefs i ve watched in horror as they ve been energized by his campaign and his presidency it s possible that hate like this would have been on the rise anyway given eight years of the obama presidency and animus toward hillary clinton but now we don t have hate on the fringe we have it reinforced in the white house most politicians of all political persuasions have released statements condemning racism and the violence in charlottesville violence that ended in the death of one person heather heyer and the injuring of many others even if these statements are political posturing they must be made our leaders need to make crystal clear where they stand now more than ever everyone needs to be unequivocal about where they stand unfortunately far too many people are being equivocal including most alarmingly the president in the days following the charlottesville unrest we have seen mr trump reluctant to disavow white supremacy the president resents that he as the leader of the united states is rightly expected to condemn hateful acts and ideas mr trump and far too many others believe there is more than one side to the story of charlottesville the president thinks that leftist resistance is as culpable as farright white supremacy he has lamented the removal of confederate statues tweeting that it is sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments as if books and museums do not exist advertisement continue reading the main story when you look at the sum of his behavior it s obvious that mr trump is actually not equivocating he is actively demonstrating that his loyalties lie with only some of the american people there are other forms of equivocating back in november pundits began attributing mr trump s win to economic anxiety because they were unwilling to face the blatant racism that fueled his popularity look where that thinking has brought us everyone who says this is not america or this is not us is being willfully ignorant of both the past and the present we all need to acknowledge that yes this is indeed us the very worst of us there are people who think it is a problem that the white supremacists from charlottesville are being publicly identified and fired from their jobs as if those who would eradicate all of us who are not aryan deserve empathy they do not a white newscaster cries because talking about race makes her uncomfortable because discomfort is most likely the worst thing she can imagine we cannot afford to delude ourselves about the state of things we cannot mollify ourselves with some ideal of neutrality or objectivity as if white supremacy deserves anything but resounding contempt taking down confederate statues is a symbolic but necessary gesture but we cannot merely dismantle these markers of america s painful past we must work to dismantle the pernicious ideologies these statues represent we must root out white supremacy wherever it lurks and call it by its name even when it makes us uncomfortable even when the people we are calling out are those we live and work with or consider friends and family we are on a precipice what happened in charlottesville is not the end of something but rather the beginning and it is from this precipice that i am reminded of everything i did not do during the 2016 election hindsight reminds me that resistance must be active and constant resistance is the responsibility of everyone who believes in equality and demands the eradication of racism antisemitism and the hatred that empowers bigots to show their truest selves in broad daylight i am reminding myself that i should never allow my fears to quiet me i have a voice and i am going to use it as loudly as i can

photo prominent police chiefs and prosecutors first raised their voices months ago against the trump administration s attempt to revive failed policing strategies and its repeated suggestion that fair constitutional law enforcement is somehow inconsistent with public safety some of those officials spoke out again over the weekend after president trump gave a speech on long island urging police officers to rough up suspects arrested in their campaign against ms13 a violent gang with roots in los angeles and central america the speech in suffolk county featured mr trump s favorite boogeymen immigrant suspects whom he referred to as animals the notion that the police might be treating people arrested in these cases too nicely drew applause from many police officers in the audience even though it implied that people are guilty just because they are arrested contradicting the basic notion of american jurisprudence advertisement continue reading the main story this reaction must have been chilling for senior officials at the suffolk county police department which has good reason to distance itself from unconstitutional policing in 2013 the department agreed to oversight by the justice department amid charges that it had discriminated against latinos and just last fall its former chief james burke was sentenced to federal prison in connection with the beating of a man who had stolen a duffel bag from his car

two examples of the president s efforts and the underlying support for his positions illustrate these trends photo on wednesday he offered his support for a bill that would cut legal immigration to the united states in half saying this legislation demonstrates our compassion for struggling american families who deserve an immigration system that puts their needs first and that puts america first to achieve its goal the plan would limit entry for some family members of american citizens and permanent residents in explaining how limiting the entry of relatives would put the needs of american families first a white house policy adviser stephen miller said it was common sense that immigration was costing americans jobs he then suggested that the family members who would be denied entry under the proposal were largely lowskill workers who were taking jobs away from struggling americans the claim about who if anyone suffers from the immigration of lowskilled workers is nuanced debate on the question is active if people come to america because they have a relative living here it does not mean by definition that they are lowskilled workers despite the difficulty of nailing down the effects of lowskilled immigration on american families public opinion on the topic at least for a particular set of americans may reflect the common sense mr miller described in january 2016 the american national election study asked 875 white americans this question how likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead on average 28 percent of the white population thought it was extremely or very likely that white people could not find work because of minorities seeking those same jobs roughly half the white population thought it was at least moderately or slightly likely only 21 percent thought this was not at all likely differences emerge across party lines even among whites close to 20 percent of democrats thought it was extremely likely that the prospects for white jobseekers would be threatened by the presence of minority workers while 34 percent of republicans and 30 percent of independents felt this way among white republicans and independents an even greater divide becomes clear white voters who preferred mr trump to one of the other candidates in the republican field were nearly twice as likely to anticipate white job loss to nonwhite workers 48 percent compared with 24 percent photo the survey also asked white people how important it was for whites to work together to change laws that are unfair to whites on average 38 percent said it was extremely or very important only a quarter thought it was not important at all a category that presumably also encompasses people who thought no such laws existed advertisement continue reading the main story these trends also help to frame president trump s other recent announcement that the justice department would be investigating college admissions procedures that might discriminate against white applicants the difference between white democrats and republicans on the importance of uniting as a group against discriminatory laws is only five percentage points with republicans believing it was more important than democrats and independents newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york timess products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters the divide however among republicans who preferred mr trump in the primaries and those who chose someone else is overwhelming nearly 60 percent of mr trump s primary supporters thought organizing to change laws that are unfair to white people was extremely or very important only 15 percent thought it was not important at all to do so supporters of other gop candidates on average were about half as concerned the data show that race is less important to white americans sense of self than to nonwhites more white people say being white is not at all important to their identity relative to the numbers who say so in other groups but mr trump s continued efforts to remind white americans of their group status may increase the number of white people who think of themselves through a racial lens it is one of the ways that his campaign and presidency may reshape public opinion and politics he is capitalizing both on an existing sense of threat among white voters and the opportunity to shape the way whites because of their group membership think of themselves

but mr murdoch is not just any chief executive and the company he runs especially its cable news network has enormous influence over the country s politics and media rupert murdoch 86 who has long pursued power rather than a specific ideology has served as an informal adviser to mr trump and repeatedly urged him to fire stephen k bannon the chief strategist and nationalist who exited the white house on friday at the same time the murdoch family controls both news corporation the owner of the journal and the post as well as 21st century fox home to a sprawling collection of movie studios and television networks while there have been some cracks in the conservative wall with the newspapers publishing more commentary critical of mr trump fox news is known as mr trump s preferred outlet that creates an uneasy balance for james murdoch 44 who is known to lean more toward the center than his father but rarely expresses political views publicly a fiscal conservative james and his progressiveminded wife kathryn have long advocated for the environment and expressed embarrassment by certain elements of fox news associates have said kathryn murdoch has expressed contempt for mr trump on her twitter feed the response from other twitter users is often critical well kathryn it would help if your family s business foxnews wasn t a synchophantic state media arm of the trump

said repeatedly that they didn t plan to significantly change the formula for fox news which fuels the company s business analysts estimate that the division generated 25 percent of 21st century fox s operating income last year which was 66 billion he is trying to straddle a recognition that there are a lot of problems out there and whether fox news has contributed to them or not the problems exist

advertisement continue reading the main story james has to be mindful that the health of the overall enterprise is dependent on fox news holding up mr wieser said through a spokesman the murdochs declined to comment in the email sent thursday mr murdoch acknowledged that he rarely offers running commentary on current affairs since he assumed the role of chief executive of 21st century fox two years ago james murdoch and his brother have pushed to modernize the company they introduced additional benefits including more paid vacation vastly enhanced reproductive coverage for women and expanded coverage for our transgender colleagues and in january they spoke out about president trump s travel ban stating in a memo to employees that they deeply value diversity and believe immigration is an essential part of america s strength while there are some examples of the brothers moving to shake up the business it is not clear how far they will go in the face of the sexual harassment scandal at fox news it was james murdoch who moved most aggressively against roger ailes the founding chairman of fox news and bill o reilly still some critics and employees said the murdochs ousted mr ailes and mr o reilly only because of public scrutiny and that the work environment had not been completely reformed some business associates and observers on friday lauded mr murdoch for taking a stand and making a donation to a charitable organization yet others questioned the sincerity behind his motives angelo carusone president of media matters a progressive media watchdog said that mr trump repeated several fox news talking points during the news conference earlier this week when he responded to questions about what happened in charlottesville advertisement continue reading the main story much of what donald trump said this week that james murdoch is condemning actually came directly from fox news mr carusone said so if james murdoch really believes what he wrote in that email then he needs to start with fox news the network that he runs it is not clear whether james murdoch cleared the note with his father before sending it although business associates said that it would be surprising if rupert murdoch hadn t signed off on it the elder mr murdoch has long supported the antidefamation league and accepted an award from the organization in 2010 for his commitment to promoting respect and speaking out against antisemitism for james murdoch his memo underscores that at least for him speaking out against racism antisemitism white supremacy and neonazis exists outside political ideology but what we watched this last week in charlottesville and the reaction to it by the president of the united states concern all of us as americans and free people mr murdoch said in the email the presence of hate in our society was appallingly laid bare as we watched swastikas brandished on the streets of charlottesville and acts of brutal terrorism and violence perpetrated by a racist mob he added i can t even believe i have to write this standing up to nazis is essential there are no good nazis or klansmen or terrorists democrats republicans and others must all agree on this and it compromises nothing for them to do so

during the campaign mr trump sometimes suggested he would scale back the united states global military commitments a policy that would have left japan an american treaty ally exposed photo but now if anything mr abe faces the opposite problem an american president who seems overtly eager to confront their mutual adversary north korea if it looks like the us set off the chain of events that led to escalation and abe didn t use his relationship with trump to moderate that it s easy to imagine that there would be a domestic price to pay said tobias harris a japan analyst at teneo intelligence a political risk consultancy based in new york the japanese public has much less appetite for brinkmanship than mr trump appears to have mr harris said mr abe a staunch conservative has made a career of arguing for a tougher line against north korea the growing threat from the north has bolstered his drive to strengthen japan s military which has long been constrained by the country s warrenouncing constitution because of that the latest escalation of tensions might seem to play into mr abe s hands on thursday north korea said it was drawing up plans to launch intermediaterange ballistic missiles into waters near guam an american territory that is home to an important air force base in the pacific the missiles it said would fly over western japan reviving memories of a north korean missile that flew over northern japan in 1998 causing a national uproar a moody young man with a nuclear arsenal the dprk has already acquired the capabilities of reducing the japanese archipelago to ashes in a second once it makes up its mind the north s state news agency said an a statement accompanying the guam plan using the initials for the country s official name the democratic people s republic of korea advertisement continue reading the main story japan is already moving to strengthen its antimissile defenses and officials are debating whether to acquire weapons like longrange cruise missiles that would allow the country to strike targets in north korea either in retaliation or preemptively if it concluded that an attack by the north was imminent deploying such weapons would break with decades of precedent and the idea is contentious in keeping with the pacifist constitution japan s military is meant to protect the country from direct attack while its partner the united states handles offensive duties like striking enemy bases a socalled shield and spear arrangement most japanese appear happy with that division of labor despite concerns about north korea and mr abe needs to tread carefully if he hopes to change it the prime minister s approval ratings have tumbled in recent months specialists say in part because voters believe he is overreaching in his efforts to roll back restrictions on the military including with controversial proposed changes to the constitution polls show that only about a third of voters support such constitutional changes photo abe will want to spend his dwindling political capital on his longheld goal of constitutional revision james l schoff a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace wrote in an article posted on thursday a bold move to acquire offensive weapons he added would undermine this effort mr abe faces a leadership contest in the governing liberal democratic party next year his

put it simply abe is a conservative one might even call him a hawk mr kishida said thursday on a television debate program adding i m a liberal a dove mr trump s combative language on north korea makes matters trickier for mr abe the president has doubled down on his war of words with mr kim s government saying a previous threat to rain down fire and fury on the north might not have been tough enough in japan such comments have served as a reminder of the risks involved in confronting the north militarily despite the north s recent development of ballistic missiles that experts say could reach the united states north korea s neighbors would probably bear the brunt of its attacks for that reason support for military action against the north is low in both south korea and japan a fact that mr trump s statements are hardly helping to change there s growing concern said hideshi takesada a specialist on defense issues at the institute of world studies at takushoku university about whether the us is really thinking about the security of japan and south korea

for mr putin to praise mr trump s business acumen if he says it we own this election mr sater wrote americas most difficult adversary agreeing that donald is a good guy to negotiate there is no evidence in the emails that mr sater delivered on his promises and one email suggests that mr sater overstated his russian ties in january 2016 mr cohen wrote to mr putin s spokesman dmitri s peskov asking for help restarting the trump tower project which had stalled but mr cohen did not appear to have mr peskov s direct email and instead wrote to a general inbox for press inquiries the project never got government permits or financing and died weeks later to be clear the trump organization has never had any real estate holdings or interests in russia the trump organization said monday in a statement mr trump however signed a nonbinding letter of intent for the project in 2015 mr cohen said he discussed the project with mr trump three times the trump organization on monday turned over emails to the house intelligence committee which is investigating russian meddling in the presidential election and whether anyone in mr trump s campaign was involved some of the emails were obtained by the times photo the emails obtained by the times do not include any responses from mr cohen to mr sater s messages in a statement on monday that was also provided to congress mr cohen suggested

not working for the trump organization and would not have been compensated by them during the course of our communications over several months i routinely expressed my enthusiasm regarding what a tremendous opportunity this was for the trump organization mr sater said mr sater was a broker for the trump organization for several years typically paid to deliver real estate deals a company he worked for bayrock played a role in financing the trump soho hotel in new york mr sater and mr cohen even worked together on a peace plan for ukraine and russia that they sought to get in front of mr trump s national security adviser earlier this year as a broker for the trump organization mr sater had an incentive to overstate his businessmaking acumen he presents himself in his emails as so influential in russia that he helped arrange a 2006 trip that mr trump s daughter ivanka took to moscow i arranged for ivanka to sit in putins private chair at his desk and office in the kremlin he said ms trump said she had no involvement in the discussions about the moscow deal other than to recommend possible architects in a statement she said that during the 2006 trip she took a brief tour of red square and the kremlin as a tourist she said it is possible she sat in mr putin s chair during that tour but she did not recall it she said she has not seen or spoken to mr sater since 2010 i have never met president vladimir putin she said advertisement continue reading the main story the times reported earlier this year on the plan for a trump tower in moscow which never materialized on sunday the washington post reported the existence of the correspondence between mr sater and mr cohen but not its content spokespeople for the house intelligence committee had no comment on the documents mr cohen has denied any wrongdoing and the trump organization turned over the emails to the house as part of his ongoing cooperation with the investigation earlier this month mr cohen s lawyer stephen m ryan wrote a letter to congressional investigators that contained what he said was a pointbypoint refutation of a dossier suggesting that mr cohen colluded with russian operatives that dossier compiled by a retired british spy and briefed to mr trump during the transition was published online early this year we do not believe that the committee should give credence to or perpetuate any of the allegations relating to mr cohen unless the committee can obtain independent and reliable corroboration mr ryan wrote
