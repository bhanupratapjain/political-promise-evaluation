# political-promise-evaluation
PPE provides a unified view of promises made by Political Candidates while campaign- ing and the promises fulfilled during their tenure. PPE aims to scour Political Manifestoâ€™s and summarize political promises. We will extract relevant Tweets on Twitter and then evaluate the the fulfillment status of the promises

### Promises
- Trump Tracker API 

### Promise Evaluation
- Twitter 
- NYT
    - search terms 'Donald Trump','mexico wall','obamacare'
    - date between  "20170120", "20171130"
    - Total articles = 624
- Google Search
-  All News Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news
    - Unlabelled, had to label.

## Data 
### Data Extraction

## Data Prepossessing
### Data Labelling
### Data Sanity

## Methodology
### Document Matching 
- Bag of Words
- Tf-Idf

### Progress Tracking
#### Lexicon Based
- Naive Bayes (NTLK - Pre trained) (Pure Sentiment)
- Pattern (Lexical) (Pure Sentiment)
#### Custom Classifier
- Custom Trained Classifier (Vader Sentiment + Bag of words for Progressive Words )
    - Train Data Labelling
        - Label = 0 (Broken or in Progress)
        - Label = 1 (Completed)
        - Label = Binary(Binary(progress_coefficient) * polarity)
            - Polarity = vader polarity
            - progress_coefficient, 
                ```
                    progress_synonyms = syn_count / total_count
                    progress_antonyms = ant_count / total_count
                    progress_coefficient  = tanh(pp) - tanh(pn)
                ```
    - Naive Bayes -> Experiment 2
    - Random Forest (TODO)
    - SVM (TODO)

### Results
    No need to make individual headings for experiments. Write what we tried. Give numbners and tables. What failed. And what ultimately worked.
