PPE provides a unified view of promises made by Political Candidates while campaign- ing and the promises fulfilled during their tenure. PPE aims to scour Political Manifestoâ€™s and summarize political promises. We will extract relevant Tweets on Twitter and then evaluate the the fulfillment status of the promises

# Report


## Data

### Promises
- Trump Tracker API 

### Promise Evaluation
- Twiiter 
- NYT
- Google Search

## Methodology

### Document Matching 
- Bag of Words
- Tf-Idf

### Progress Tracking
- Naive Bayes (NTLK - Pre trained) (Pure Sentiment)
- Pattern (Lexical) (Pure Sentiment)
- Custom Trained Classifier (Vader Sentiment + Bag of words for Progressive Words )
    - Train Data Labelling
        - Label = 0 (Broken or in Progress)
        - Label = 1 (Completed)
        - Label = Binary(Binary(progress_coefficient) * polarity)
            - Polarity = vader polarity
            - progress_coefficient, 
                ```
                    progress_synonyms = syn_count / total_count
                    progress_antonyms = ant_count / total_count
                    progress_coefficient  = tanh(pp) - tanh(pn)
                ```
