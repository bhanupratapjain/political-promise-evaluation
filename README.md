# Political Promise Evaluation
PPE provides a unified view of promises made by Political Candidates while campaigning and the promises fulfilled during their tenure. PPE aims to scour Political Manifestoâ€™s and summarize political promises. We will extract relevant Tweets on Twitter and then evaluate the the fulfillment status of the promises

## Running Instructions
```
- Setup Python Version >= 3
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Get data from https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news. Extract under directory "data"
- python PPE.py
- Check the output on console and under dir "out" and "plots" (Exsiting data will be overwriten)
```
