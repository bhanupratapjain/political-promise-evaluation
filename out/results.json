of any russian involvement in the digital and data operation of the 2016 trump presidential campaign mr parscale s firms were by far the highestpaid vendors on the trump committee s payrolls and those

february border patrol agents near douglas ariz found and dismantled a catapult that was used by smugglers in mexico to fire two bundles of marijuana weighing about 47 pounds in total into the united states since 2012 there were several instances in which border patrol agents found smugglers using air guns to launch drugs over border fencing in one case agents seized more than 30 cans filled with

understanding on a path forward without the united states we need a new international agreement mr umemoto said i think we have reached a rough picture of what it will be like momentum for such deals has built in recent weeks as big american allies have pledged their commitment to globalization on the eve of the group of 20 summit meeting in hamburg germany last week japan and the european union announced the outlines of a broad agreement that would create a trading bloc encompassing 20 trillion in combined economic output the deal was announced as the united states appeared increasingly isolated on issues like free trade and the environment president trump has repeatedly made clear his antipathy toward free trade vowing to protect american workers and rebalance trade deficits with other countries on wednesday the united states trade representative robert e lighthizer sent a letter to the south korean government saying that the administration was eager to revise a trade agreement between the two countries that has been in force for five years if japan and the 10 other signatories are to keep the tpp alive they would need at the very least to revise a clause that says the deal will come into effect only when ratified by six countries representing 85 percent of the combined economic value of the 12 original members without the united states that threshold cannot be reached japan which has the largest economy among the remaining trade partners is pushing to preserve most of the ambitious rules that negotiators originally hammered out as are australia and new zealand advertisement continue reading the main story the hope of course of japan is to maintain the status quo of the already agreed framework including the details said tomohiko taniguchi a foreign policy adviser to prime minister shinzo abe while optimistic that japan could lead the group toward consensus mr taniguchi who referred to the remaining tpp countries as the ocean s 11 acknowledged that the discussions would be challenging negotiations once started could turn in all sorts of different directions he said it s a gathering of 11 after all selfcentered even selfish countries all sorts of negotiations are likely happening developing countries such as malaysia and vietnam may want to renegotiate some of the tougher requirements that they accepted in exchange for the promise of access to american markets the agreement for example requires developing nations to reform childlabor laws as well as to improve the transparency of stateowned companies and it permits drug makers in the large economies to extend patent protection on many pharmaceuticals that the smaller countries want to manufacture some of the developing countries may protest that such requirements are too

research fellow at the perth usasia center at the university of western australia for developing countries being asked to make expensive overhauls mr wilson said what is the point of the deal anymore japan s goal is to preserve as much of the original deal as possible in the hope that the united states will eventually rejoin we should welcome the united states when the united states decides to come back at some time in the future said ichiro fujisaki a former japanese ambassador to washington some observers see those hopes as na\u00efve i think it s simply wishful thinking that the trump administration will change its mind about the tpp said takuji okubo managing director and chief economist at japan macro advisors so long as he remains the president i don t think he will actually make that turnaround advertisement continue reading the main story others suggested that advisers to mr trump might try to change his mind once he sees how difficult it can be to negotiate bilateral trade agreements but in that case they say the 11 remaining countries should not alter the tpp if they try to renegotiate the rules or lower the standards it will make it harder for the us to rejoin the agreement down the road said bruce h andrews deputy secretary of the commerce department in the obama administration and now a managing director at rock creek global advisors a consulting firm and there is another reason the tpp countries should maintain the tough trade rules mr andrews said to push china toward reform if tpp had gone into force the chinese by necessity would eventually have wanted to be part of it to enjoy its benefits mr andrews said in order to get into tpp china would have had to do some serious economic reform and open their market from their current closed state if tpp does not go forward as the model china will likely get better terms from other countries without having to open its market in japan mr abe has his own political reasons for wanting to push ahead with the tpp mr abe expended considerable political capital for the deal going up against farmers who have traditionally supported his liberal democratic party the agreement would require japan s closed agricultural sector to accept imports of rice pork and other products mr abe has also recently been dogged by influencepeddling scandals and his party suffered a resounding defeat in a recent local election in tokyo by agreeing to the trade deal with the european union last week he was able to score a quick victory i think it s important to keep that momentum said jun saito a senior research fellow at the japan center for economic research japan has indicated that it wants to secure an agreement between the remaining 11 countries in the transpacific partnership by november when many of them will gather at a summit meeting in vietnam most analysts say any agreement is unlikely to be completed that quickly still said shumpei takemori a professor of economics at keio university

committees not including the 66 million he donated to his campaign in some ways the shift to highdollar fundraising represents a move toward a more traditional political operation than the one that helped power mr trump s upset victory in 2016 his campaign relied more on donations from mr trump s own pocket he has not donated to his reelection campaign and on the power of megarallies and his social media presence than on traditional and costly political infrastructure like field offices and television advertising it is unusual however for a sitting president s team to be raising money and building a reelection effort in the first half of a first term when political and fundraising efforts are typically channeled through the president s national party committee the reports show that mr trump s committees spent 229000 on salaries and political and communications consulting the committees spent 21 million on digital consulting all of which went to firms associated with the san antoniobased consultant brad parscale who served as digital director of mr trump s 2016 campaign and who is now advising a nonprofit group seeking to raise huge sums of cash to boost mr trump s legislative agenda mr parscale and the trump campaign data operation have attracted the interest of congressional investigators looking into the trump campaign s digital operation in connection with the russia investigations on friday mr parscale posted on twitter that he had accepted an invitation to appear before the house intelligence committee writing i am unaware of any russian involvement in the digital and data operation of the 2016 trump presidential campaign mr parscale s firms were by far the highestpaid vendors on the trump committee s payrolls and those payments seem to indicate
