fingerprints shared by local law enforcement departments to find and deport immigrants who commit crimes the provisions are chilling to many immigration advocates who argued that they could sweep up unauthorized immigrants beyond the criminals mr trump says he wants to target among those listed as priorities for removal are those who have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency which would essentially include any undocumented worker who has signed an employment agreement in the united states the order also includes a section that directs federal agencies to adjust their privacy policies to exclude unauthorized immigrants in effect allowing the sharing of their personal identifying information

nation of immigrants said representative nancy pelosi of california the democratic leader wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on a border wall mexico will never pay for and punishing cities that do not want their local police forces forced to serve as president trump s deportation dragnet does nothing to fix our immigration system or keep americans safe the order on refugees is in line with a muslim ban that mr trump proposed during the campaign though it does not single out any particular religion it orders the secretary of state and the secretary of homeland security to prioritize those

these are the prototypes for the border wall president trump has vowed to erect on the southern border later this year the federal government will test the panels for strength and effectiveness these prototypes make clear that a border wall is not simple it can vary considerably in material shape and cost and while it is far from clear that congress will pay for a wall or that any of these designs will be built at wider scale they are reallife renderings of a promise that fueled much of mr trump s campaign six contractors have made bids on the wall and the specific details of their plans are not public but they allowed us to visit the prototypes and we asked border security experts and engineers what they saw in each design and what challenges each wall may face every expert agreed on one thing finding a design that would work for the entire length of the border would be extremely hard if not impossible and many caution that such a wall may never happen concrete or no concrete concrete not concrete the prototypes include plain concrete walls and ones made of a combination of materials what the government described as other than concrete the term is intentionally vague a signal to contractors to be creative and bring a design that us customs and border protection had not considered any barrier must be able to withstand at least 30 minutes of force from a sledgehammer car jack pick axe chisel batteryoperated impact tools batteryoperated cutting tools oxyacetylene torch or other similar handheld tools according to the instructions for the prototypes some other than concrete prototypes incorporate steel which can be relatively easy to cut with a torch while pure concrete is not a hollow steel pipe whose walls are half an inch thick could easily be cut in less than an hour according to michael d engelhardt professor of structural engineering at the university of texas at austin steel is also malleable mr engelhardt said that a small hydraulic arm similar to the jaws of life used to pry open a crumpled car could easily be used to make an opening in such a wall the equipment is small could likely fit in a backpack inexpensive widely available and can generate many tons of force steel can rust really quickly said curtis patterson a structural engineer based in san diego who visited the prototypes with a team of times journalists he pointed to several rust spots that had already appeared on one of the prototypes less than a month after construction but some envision the mixedmaterial walls as having more technological capabilities they might be called smart walls walls that incorporate radar acoustics and other types of surveillance embedded in the infrastructure one of the contractors bidding on the wall is elta north america an israeli defense contractor that specializes in radar and communication equipment my sense is they will select multiple awards for these types of infrastructure said jayson ahern a former acting commissioner of customs and border protection who was involved in the construction of a border fence during the george w bush administration some will be for technology some for when they just need a wall opaque or transparent opaque transparent david aguilar a former deputy commissioner of customs and border protection said that with concerns over officer safety it is critical that border patrol agents have good situational awareness it can be done visually or it could be done with technology but in a highactivity area it is difficult to discern legal activity versus illegal in urban areas you re going to need that transparency in terms of attempted intrusion you want to see people coming toward the border so that they can respond michael evangelistaysasaga the chief executive of penna group which has contracted with the government before but whose prototype bid was rejected said a seethrough border wall allows them to know when they are facing threats on the other side which border patrol has long preferred on their wish list they didn t want a solid wall going through was never the real threat the real threat is going over or under big and beautiful more aesthetics fewer aesthetics mr trump campaigned on a big fat beautiful wall so it s unsurprising that looks play a role in the border wall guidelines the official proposal request says that the usfacing side of the wall should be aesthetically pleasing but standing in front of the prototypes mr patterson winced when he considered the aesthetics of a potential wall i don t know if there s a way to make these beautiful unless you get murals painted on them he said with a chuckle you want something that blends in that you wouldn t be offended to look at from your backyard some of the steel looks like something you d find in a prison the brick facade is more like something you d see on a freeway the only wall that actually has a brick facade is the prototype from texas sterling construction but in keeping with the guidelines the pattern appears only on the usfacing side what mexico gets to see is a bare concrete wall lined with barbed wire facing the united states facing mexico it turns out that barbed wire presents its own problems mr evangelistaysasaga said that his company often uses razor wire in prisons and that animals routinely get stuck for humans hair and clothing could get tangled in it having such wire along the border would be really inhumane he said you re going to read about a whole family dead on a sunday morning it s going to be a human rights nightmare in the international world precast or filled onsite precast filledin the engineers and contractors agree that concrete walls aren t the most complicated of structures to deal with for them the big question is do you make walls onsite or precast them lengthy wall segments in very remote regions can make pouring concrete onsite expensive and logistically difficult most experts thought that precasting making the concrete panels elsewhere and then shipping them to the border was the most practical choice rather than build from point a to point b the wall route could be divided into segments say 100 miles apart said daniel abrams a professor of structural engineering at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign tube or no tube tube no tube border patrol officials have repeatedly said that they want to construct a wall that would be effectively impossible to scale that it should be physically imposing measure between 18 and 30 feet high and include anticlimbing features many of the contractors added a rounded tube at the top of their prototypes they believe it will make it far less likely that anyone could reach the top it makes it impossible to straddle or use to get a rope ladder across because there is nothing to hook onto deputy chief patrol agent roy d villareal said"

get 12 republicans to vote for daca or the dream act without putting something on the table said senator richard j durbin of illinois an coauthor of the dream act which would offer a path to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants who arrived as children there s always going to be a group that wants more there are some people who want all or nothing democrats need to be mindful not just of white workingclass voters but all voters said cornell belcher who worked as one of president barack obama s pollsters during his 2008 presidential campaign democrats have to thread a fine needle he said because polls show that voters broadly feel as though their borders need to be more secure but activists worry that any compromise could carry a very personal price their own longterm safety might be secured only in exchange for an increased threat of deportation for their undocumented parents and friends who do not qualify for such protections under the program video that is a deal that many of them are not willing to take we are going to do whatever it takes to push both parties to pursue what we are demanding said cristina jim\u00e9nez executive director of united we

prospect of a strangebedfellows deal on one of the most contentious political issues of the last two decades emerged last month after mr trump and the two democrats dined at the white house the working dinner set the stage for an endoftheyear clash in congress over border security limits on immigration and the fate of the young immigrants known as dreamers advertisement continue reading the main story mr trump had announced an end to his predecessor s program before the dinner but his willingness to pursue a bipartisan legislative deal to enshrine the program into law set off a furious response from conservatives on television news programs that the president is known to watch that has made the legislative path forward far from certain mr trump is under pressure from inside and outside his administration to insist on an array of tough immigration control measures in exchange for what his supporters view as amnesty for the undocumented immigrants administration officials say he will soon release a set of principles that will guide his dealmaking with the democrats conservatives want those principles to include a call to limit the number of new legal immigrants and emphasize the entry of highskilled workers instead of the family members of immigrants already in the country they want to expand the everify system to ensure that businesses do not hire undocumented workers they are insisting on steppedup immigration enforcement throughout the country s interior and they want mr trump to get his wall along the southern border photo immigration activists reject such demands as meanspirited and too farreaching previous legislative efforts during the administrations of george w bush and mr obama considered that breadth of immigration enforcement but only in exchange for a path to citizenship for all 12 million of the undocumented immigrants in the country not the smaller pool of socalled dreamers those young immigrants and their allies say they will not accept what they consider draconian measures in exchange for a deal on daca or on the dream act the bill dating back to 2001 that would provide a pathway to citizenship for young immigrants brought in illegally as children i think senator schumer crumbles under pressure just so he can deliver on something said cesar adrian vargas an immigrantrights advocate and a daca recipient but the larger

without compromising that drama is likely to play out at the end of the year as lawmakers in both parties face a middecember deadline to fund the government and extend some popular initiatives like

authorities president trump has amplified his harsh line on illegal immigration and renewed his promise to build a border wall then came the chaos of hurricane harvey families among houston s estimated 600000 undocumented immigrants the largest number of any city in the united states except new york and los angeles according to the pew research center fled their homes to escape the

harvey the border patrol did not suspend operations at checkpoints in texas on saturday even after the storm unleashed destruction in parts of the state drawing sharp rebukes from human rights

the position taken just last october by the border patrol during hurricane matthew when authorities explicitly said that there would be no immigration enforcement checkpoints officials with the border

withstand being underwater said miriam camero a caseworker in houston for raices an immigrant legalaid group based in san antonio sowing confusion and fear among some people here more than two dozen border patrol agents from a special operations detachment in south texas arrived in houston with a dozen vessels to help with the emergency relief effort but manuel padilla jr a chief patrol agent with the agency found it necessary to go on the local univision news in houston to reassure people in spanish that the agents were here to save the lives of people endangered by the storm not to check their documents for many undocumented immigrants the sight of border patrol boats on their flooded streets was enough to frighten them just physically and visually seeing the border patrol out there caused panic said cesar espinosa executive director of fiel houston an immigrant rights organization they thought they were coming to get them houston s mayor sylvester turner a democrat sought to ease some of the anxiety reflecting houston s reputation as a frequently progressive immigrantfriendly city but mr turner also stepped into the fray over a bill passed by the state legislature in may known as senate bill 4 scheduled to go into effect on friday unless a federal judge enjoins it after several localities challenged it in court the law would ban police chiefs sheriffs and other lawenforcement officials from stopping an officer from questioning an individual about his or her immigration status it would also mandate that jail administrators honor all requests from ice to hold an immigrant who is deportable for the agency to pick up in a news conference on monday mr turner called for putting the law on the shelf while the city focuses on rescuing victims of the storm still organizations that assist immigrants expressed an array of concerns over sb 4 considered the harshest antiillegal immigrant law since arizona passed a tough bill years ago that was watered down by the supreme court the sb 4 issue is very real in our community and although sb 4 does not require any local official to check immigration status it certainly has created a climate of fear said geoffrey hoffman director of the immigration clinic at the university of houston law center i think the recent words of the mayor may have ameliorated some of our concerns he added but again people do not know how or if things will change after september 1 given the statewide effective date a lack of trust among immigrants has deepened since president trump was inaugurated in january and immigration arrests particularly of those without criminal records ramped up the history is ice says one thing and does another said barbie hurtado a community organizer for raices the san antonio legal services group the fear is out there people don t want to come out and say who they are and seek help adding to the fear ms hurtado said are reports that mr trump is weighing ending an obama administration program that has granted permission to stay and work to about 800000 immigrants who were brought illegally to the united states as children for some of the families sleeping on cots in houston s convention center the signals coming from washington and the state capital austin were clear and alarming all we want to do is work hard and raise a family said jorge a 43yearold employee of a houston catering company declining to give his last name he explained that he had to seek shelter with his wife and three daughters after their home was flooded when he was asked about his immigration status he simply looked at the floor and said that he and his wife moved to houston years ago from guanajuato in central mexico this is where we are right now at the mercy of the elements he said we were already so scared it would be a disgrace if they come after us now"

senators who have been reluctant to support it like earlier repeal efforts the new plan would also repeal the individual mandate to purchase insurance and get rid of certain subsidies for outofpocket health expenses but the measure still has important differences from the three bills that failed to pass the senate in july and the one that passed the house in may and it is those differences that create more uncertainty about the bill s impact on the lives of millions of americans how the cassidygraham plan compares with other republican bills cassidygraham skinny repeal partial repeal repeal

results expected next week failed 4951 failed 4555 failed 4357 passed 217213 increase in the number of uninsured in 10 years no score 16 million 32 million no score 23 million the latest bill introduced by senator bill cassidy of louisiana and senator lindsey graham of south carolina gives states sweeping discretion to come up with their own health care systems through federal block grants this would mean the biggest devolution of federal money and responsibility to states ever and the results would be very unpredictable said larry levitt a policy expert at the kaiser family foundation 1 states would get block grants in place of money for affordable care act programs the cassidygraham bill would repeal the expansion of medicaid coverage to poor adults and cancel subsidies that help middleincome americans afford insurance beginning in 2020 states would get block grants they could use to replicate the affordable care act programs if they wanted to or develop their own health care plans in the latest version of the cassidygraham bill states represented by senators who have been on the fence including alaska and maine would receive more money than under the current law how it compares no other republican plan called for replacing money for medicaid expansion and subsidies with lump sums to states under most of the earlier plans the way those programs are funded would have changed but the medicaid expansion and subsidies would not have been completely defunded lump sums were made available to the states in both the house bill and one of the earlier senate bills but the amounts were smaller and were intended to cover costs like premium increases that would result from repealing the individual mandate or creating highrisk pools impact the effects of the plan would depend entirely on what health insurance systems states decided to create but over all there would be less federal money to work with and states that have expanded coverage for more of their residents under the affordable care act would get less money under the plan while some states may use their block grants to replicate affordable care act programs or provide other forms of health insurance others may use the block grants to substitute for existing state spending instead of using it to offer health insurance to people covered under the affordable care act that choice could mean widely disparate outcomes in how many people retain coverage from state to state 2 states can set many of their own health insurance standards under the revised bill states would not have to preserve some of the affordable care act s insurance regulations if they did not want to states could for example decide to allow insurers to omit some of the benefits they are currently required to provide like coverage for maternity care mental health care and drug addiction treatment they could also let companies offer much skimpier plans experts say that the language in the bill is confusing and inconsistent but it appears that the revised bill would weaken the protections for people with preexisting conditions and allow insurers to charge higher prices based on a person s health status how it compares the cassidygraham bill proposes keeping the insurance market rules but asks states to waive them if they like by contrast one of the senate plans that failed to pass had proposed waiving the rules at the federal level but it would have allowed states to keep them if they liked the house bill had proposed allowing states to seek waivers for the regulations but also allowed for an 8 billion fund to help people with preexisting conditions impact under the plan people with preexisting conditions could be at risk of being priced out of the market because insurers in some states could charge them higher prices it is possible that even if they could afford insurance that the skimpier benefit rules would mean that their plan did not cover some of the services they needed republican leaders have repeatedly said that they would like to preserve protections for those with preexisting conditions president trump said that the cassidygraham bill would protect them but that would be true only in states that chose not to eliminate those rules 3 federal funding disappears in 2027 the state block grant program established under the bill would end after 2026 unless congress decided to renew it how it compares while previous bills proposed cuts and modifications to the affordable care act programs neither the house bill nor the earlier senate bills proposed letting the funding expire impact if congress did not renew the block grants tens of millions of people would lose health insurance because states would have to roll back coverage or replace federal dollars any new programs states created with the block grants would most likely end"

act has shifted the nation s baseline expectations for how health care should work its successes have pushed republican politicians like mr trump into making expansive promises to provide insurance to all americans its failures have become focal points too leading to calls for lower insurance deductibles and for more choices in doctors and hospitals since republicans took power public opinion has suddenly tipped in its favor for lots of people obamacare has become synonymous with the health care system itself with its many miracles and dysfunctions there are layers beneath each judgment of course the law was broad and complex with many goals and provisions this assessment touches on its largest achievements and its biggest disappointments for many important questions there is not yet strong evidence either way successes twenty million more people have health insurance providing health coverage to the uninsured was obamacare s principal goal and on that measure it has succeeded the gain of 20 million insured based on an obama administration estimate last year is probably now even higher not everyone shares the goal of expanded health coverage and some of those newly insured bristle under an individual mandate to have insurance or pay a fine still many of the newly insured could not have afforded insurance before the law passed or would have been shut out because of preexisting health conditions the rapid reduction in the number of uninsured americans has shifted the political debate about health reform in 2009 many republicans were comfortable with a status quo

analysis disagreed advertisement continue reading the main story it has made many americans more financially secure health insurance is supposed to provide access to health care but it is also a financial product intended to protect people from catastrophic bills if they are sick or injured it is still early to measure the health law s full impact but several studies have found that lowincome

insurance for those with low and middle incomes but it also raised taxes on high earners this mix of policies made the law controversial but it also furthered the obama administration s goals of narrowing the gap between rich and poor americans it made health insurance more comprehensive before obamacare many products could be called health insurance now health plans are required to cover services like maternity care and treatment for drug addiction and they can t cap how much they will pay in a given year many of the law s critics dislike its numerous coverage mandates but the new rules have increased patients access to services like mental health counseling contraception and cancer screenings it lowered the federal deficit obamacare was devised with a mix of new spending and taxes along with cuts to the federal medicare program so that it would save more than it cost a recent forecast from the congressional budget office estimates that if left in place the affordable care act will continue to save federal dollars through at least 2025 recent legislation has made some small changes to the law s tax provisions but analysts at the committee for a responsible federal budget ran the numbers again and found very little difference failures health insurance remains very expensive obamacare s marketplaces and medicaid expansion make health coverage a good deal for those near the poverty line but those earning not much more still often struggle to pay health plan premiums and face deductibles that are much higher than those seen in a typical employer health plan in the law s first three years premiums were lower than expected and grew slowly but prices shot up this year causing financial shocks for buyers who don t receive government help in paying their premiums several analysts believe the increases resulted from recent policy changes and toolow early pricing and may represent a onetime market correction insurers have also said that they have found the pool of obamacare enrollees to be sicker and less predictable in their health care needs than expected some people who earn enough to qualify for meager or no subsidies find health care unaffordable the health care system remains complex and confusing president barack obama has described the health law s markets as being like a kayak or an amazon for health insurance they re not health insurance is easier to shop for now but it remains a complicated and opaque product and selecting the right health plan is often frustrating or impossible for americans unsure of their health needs or unable to decode jargon like outofpocket maximum or innetwork provider after picking their insurance patients can still struggle to use it and can get stuck with surprise bills or long negotiations with their insurance companies photo in many parts of the country only one insurer even offers health plans limiting the choices available to consumers if you like your plan you can t always keep your plan the obamacare marketplaces are set up to encourage customers to frequently switch their health plans to avoid steep price increases the markets have also been turbulent with insurers going out of business exiting markets or shifting around their offerings each year that has led to a large fraction of renewing customers who change health plans every year unable to pick a plan they like and stick with it or your doctor many obamacare health plans trying to keep prices competitive have sharply limited the number of doctors or hospitals they will cover obamacare s authors did not expect socalled narrow network plans to become so widespread these have made it hard for some customers to find any plan that includes their favored providers and means that switching plans often means switching doctors too the narrower networks despite their inconveniences have helped keep insurance prices lower advertisement continue reading the main story too soon to tell we don t know if the law made america healthier health insurance is not the same thing as health and we still have very limited data about whether the law s coverage expansion has lengthened lives or improved their quality in meaningful ways there is some encouraging but very early evidence that lowincome people in two states that expanded medicaid reported improving overall health compared with their lowincome neighbors in a state that did not and there is research that more lowincome americans have visited a doctor and have received some basic preventive health services including prescription contraceptives and treatments for diabetes but it will probably take many more years before it is clear whether the law has been beneficial to public health or how large that effect may be even though the law allowed 20 million more people to get coverage that s a small fraction of the nation s population and it often takes years for health care services to result in measurable benefits it s unclear what the law has done to national health spending a crucial goal for mr obama was bending the cost curve and slowing the accelerating cost of health care in the united states growth in health spending has indeed slowed in the years since obamacare s passage but it is hard to untangle the effects of the health law from other forces affecting health spending including the great recession rising insurance deductibles and a slowdown in the development of new medical technologies the health law s most ardent champions including mr obama credit it for this change but many economists are uncertain whether the slowdown is a result of the law or a mere coincidence it may have improved the quality of care in hospitals the health law contained many provisions intended to make medical care safer and more evidencebased the health system is still often a dangerous place for patients but fewer are contracting infections in the hospital for example or leaving the hospital only to be readmitted in a few weeks some trends were underway before the health law passed so it is difficult to tease out how much change was caused by obamacare or would have happened anyway"

compromise it lets individual state governments decide whether they want to stick with obamacare or not which would mean that the law would remain intact in most blue states for the time being while redder states would have the opportunity to turn roughly the same amount of money 95 percent to a different end that end would look like one of the more plausible conservative alternatives to obamacare a subsidy to cover the cost of a catastrophic health insurance plan plus a directly funded health savings account to cover primary care this system could be layered on top of the existing medicaid expansion replacing only the obamacare subsidies and exchanges or it could replace the medicaid expansion as well offering the poor and near poor the same catastrophic insurance plus a subsidy as everyone else in the individual market either way the individual mandate would disappear but people would be autoenrolled in a catastrophic plan with the option to opt out meaning that coverage would be nearly universal thus fulfilling one of president trump s various promises even though its benefits would be less comprehensive than obamacare s taken as a whole this approach distills both the promise and the peril of conservative health care policy the promise is that by having people pay for more of their health care in cash and by giving them more freedom in what plans they re allowed to buy you would end up with less spending lower prices and less cost inflation and you wouldn t need the heavy innovationsquashing price controls that singlepayer systems use to get there the peril is that there would be too wide a gap between what the money in your health savings account covers and what you need before your catastrophic coverage kicks in in which case many

encourages governors and legislators to actually put the conservative theory of health care to the test without simply reversing the ideological colors of the great obamacare experiment and immediately turning the entire united states health care system over to the right s technocratic vision advertisement continue reading the main story of course this would mean that obamacare s existing problems would persist in the states where it continues but those problems the rise in premiums the fleeing insurers the risk of a death spiral downstream are not equally problematic in every state and they are not fiscally dangerous as yet on the scale that many conservatives initially feared as the conservative policy thinker yuval levin wrote late last year the striking thing about obamacare to date is how much smaller than expected its effect on the overall health care system has been fewer people are being insured on the exchanges than liberals hoped fewer employers are dumping highcost employees onto the exchanges than conservatives feared and as a result he writes the extremely serious problems we are seeing now are within the one system that obamacare created from scratch the exchange system that system may not survive and its condition has a lot to teach us about the problems with liberal health economics but it is a much smaller system than anyone thought it would be at this point about half the size that cbo projected so that the effects of any failure it suffers are likely to be more contained than anyone might have expected this containment means that conservatives have room and time to be more patient cautious and experimental than were the obama democrats before them if the obamacare exchanges aren t ultimately going to work out then allowing them to persist in liberal states while an alternative system gets set up in red states is a reasonable way to gradually transition from the liberal model toward the conservative one if the right s wonks are right about health policy the cassidycollins approach should gradually enable conservatives to prove it and if the right is wrong if its model doesn t match reality if people are simply miserable as health care consumers because the system has too much of friedman and not enough of burke well in that case both the country and conservatism will be better off if we learn that via a voter rebellion in 10 rightleaning states rather than through a much more widespread backlash against a nationwide healthinsurance failure which is something a president with a high selfregard and poor approval ratings might have a particular reason to avoid between this reasonable case and legislative reality of course falls a variety of shadows but more than for the various repealandreplace alternatives i m not so sure right now the cassidycollins compromise has few enthusiastic backers in a few months however it might turn into conservative health care reform s best hope"

well above the national average of 17 percent but the health care law has allowed selfemployed residents and owners of very small businesses to have insurance for the first time in years it s been good to have it said charles smith a lobsterman from jonesport whose wife and three teenagers were sporadically without insurance for years before the law ms collins has been a critic of the affordable care act since it was enacted she has cited the instability in the insurance markets the increasing costs of premiums especially in rural northern areas and the scarcity of health care facilities that accept the plans during the trump presidency she said the tension over access has been exacerbated by the administration s mixed messages on cost sharing the administration has wavered on whether to continue government payments to health insurance companies to offset their customers outofpocket medical expenses the uncertainty is extremely problematic said eric a cioppa the superintendent of the maine bureau of insurance who said carriers could not fix their rates without knowing the fate of those subsidies if they don t get a subsidy i fully expect doubledigit increases for three carriers on the exchanges here ms collins also said she would like to see a fix to the wage cliff in which a single dollar increase over the affordable care act s income threshold can cost a worker the full value of his insurance subsidy it is a special problem for seasonal workers whose incomes fluctuate throughout the year i really dislike that the law discourages work and pay raises she said maine has been viewed by republicans as a possible model for some reforms it was one of a handful of states that embraced a guaranteed issue policy of health insurance regardless of preexisting medical conditions and it created invisible highrisk pools to help sick people buy insurance and stabilize the markets photo republicans cite maine as the model for the risk pool in the

the exchanges is that the pools are not large enough she said it would cost 15 billion annually to expand nationally a patient stability fund like maine did a state bill that loosened community rating rules and deregulated the insurance market could also be a model for a republican health care bill that allows states more waivers from federal rules many state health care experts see that as a way to get more flexibility and experimentation in insurance markets for instance ms collins thinks maine should embrace a medicaid expansion modeled on the one adopted by indiana after the state obtained a waiver from the obama administration indiana included managedcare plans in its medicaid expansion and a requirement that poor people contribute to savings accounts which are then applied to the portion of their medical bills maine also has one of the few viable health insurance cooperatives in the nation which was hugely popular but has struggled to stay solvent because of high health care costs for maine s newly insured it is on a better footing this year maine health care experts are watching ms collins carefully in the debate which republicans would like to see reach its climax before the july fourth recess i think she is very conscious of the fact that if you move forward with a plan that gives tax credits to higherincome people but not a 60yearold in presque isle that is not a good move for our state said emily brostek the executive director of consumers for affordable health care in augusta me rural maine voters who largely supported mr trump in his election are

defines the middle class broadly as those earning between twothirds and twice the median household income or about 50000 to 160000 per year for a family of three to focus on families the analysis excluded individual filers and households headed by people 65 or older and is adjusted for the size of each household under the house bill the times has found about half of middleclass families would pay more in taxes in 2026 the analysis did not seek to calculate how workers might benefit from a steep cut in the corporate tax rate which both the senate and house bills would reduce to 20 percent from a top rate of 35 percent today or project how the bills might increase economic growth and with it americans wages on friday the independent tax foundation released an analysis of the plan s growth effects it projected that the senate bill would increase gross domestic product by 37 percent over the next decade and raise wages by 29 percent across the economy for taxpayers earning more than 1 million a year the senate bill offers a more limited upside and downside than the house bill advertisement continue reading the main story the senate bill is less likely than the house bill to yield tax increases for highincome americans in part because it cuts the top marginal personal tax rate while the house bill creates a socalled bubble rate that would actually raise taxes on many

view all new york times newsletters the senate measure would also produce a smaller average tax windfall for high earners than the house version in part by offering less generous benefits for owners of businesses known as passthroughs which are not organized as corporations under the senate plan americans are especially likely to face a tax increase if they have a smaller family have mostly wage income instead of investment income or claim some of the many deductions that the bill repeals like those for state and local taxes and employee business expenses said lily batchelder a professor and tax specialist at new york university law school who worked on economic policy in the obama administration they are increasing taxes on many in the middle class while concentrating their tax cuts on the wealthy the senate bill appears much better for the very wealthy than it is for the somewhat wealthy about half of families earning between two and three times the median income or about 160000 to 240000 for a family of three would pay more in 2018 than under existing law but among the richest families those earning more than about 500000 for a family of three nearly 90 percent would get a tax cut the findings come with an important caveat the senate bill as written appears unable to muster the 60 votes needed to avoid a democratic filibuster meaning republicans will need to amend it to comply with the budget reconciliation rules and allow permit passage by a simple majority those changes could likely include putting expiration dates on some of the bill s major provisions which could make the final version of the bill look less favorable to the middle class particularly in later years the times s figures are based on an analysis of census bureau data using a tax model from the open source policy center a washington research organization affiliated with the rightleaning american enterprise institute because the analysis is based on publicly available data not actual tax records it may not capture all the intricacies of americans household finances the senate bill differs sharply from the house version in its approach to cutting taxes on businesses but when it comes to taxes on individuals and families the bills are more similar than different both would double the standard deduction while eliminating a raft of deductions and credits both would make the child tax credit more generous both would restructure federal income tax brackets to impose lower marginal tax rates at most income levels although the senate approach unlike the house version doesn t eliminate two brackets entirely the senate bill includes features that would make its plan more favorable to the middle class it preserves some popular tax deductions and credits that the house bill initially would have eliminated and it makes the child tax credit somewhat more generous and widely available on the other hand the senate bill unlike the house version would eliminate the deduction for property taxes which could lead to higher federal taxes for homeowners in areas with high property tax rates or expensive housing markets aparna mathur an economist at the american enterprise institute said senators could improve the bill with further changes such as expanding the earnedincome tax credit and extending the benefits of the child tax credit to more lowincome taxpayers we clearly need to do more to help the lowestincome families she said at the same time we can engage in more base broadening for the highestincome households perhaps by eliminating and not just capping the mortgageinterest deduction advertisement continue reading the main story the times analysis found that roughly onefifth of the senate bill s cuts in 2018 would go to families and individuals earning 1 million or more and close to half would go to people earning at least 200000 between 10 million and 15 million taxpayers earning less than 100000 a year would pay more than under existing law families earning more than 1 million a year would see their aftertax income rise by about 17 percent in 2018 compared with what they would make under current law nearly triple the gains enjoyed by those earning less than 200000 over all the senate bill would cut individual income taxes by about 30 billion in 2018 and by 900 billion over the next decade according to congress s nonpartisan joint committee on taxation and most people in all income groups would see a tax cut although the cuts would be modest for most lower earners"

couples filing jointly sources internal revenue service house ways and means committee while the lowest income rate would increase typical families in the existing 10 percent bracket would most likely be better off because of a larger child tax credit and an increase in the standard deduction the full effects of the plan on different groups has not yet been analyzed by experts the bill would repeal the individual alternative minimum tax which primarily affects households with incomes from 200000 to 1 million and would maintain preferential rates for investment income it would also repeal the estate tax after six years in the meantime doubling the amount of inherited wealth that is exempt from the tax to 11 million from 55 million increase the standard deduction and child tax credit the plan would nearly double the amount of the standard deduction and eliminate the personal exemption a deduction based on the number of taxpayers and the dependents claimed on a return the new single

84 percent of filers who currently itemize their deductions would take the standard deduction if it were doubled to help pay for the increase the plan would eliminate other deductions with the exception of deductions for mortgage interest charitable contributions and state and local property taxes the mortgage interest deduction would be capped for newly purchased homes up to 500000 and the property tax deduction would be capped at 10000 eliminate the state and local tax deduction the biggest deduction that would be eliminated is the one for state and local taxes that deduction primarily helps people in blue states where taxes are higher republicans made a lastminute change to the bill that would retain some of the property tax portion of the deduction but many uppermiddle class

institute on retirement security about 45 percent have not saved a cent toward it mr trump sensitive to the firestorm that could be provoked by limits on 401k contributions tweeted that there would be no change to this great and popular middle class tax break before conceding it might be a part of legislative horsetrading representative kevin brady of texas the principal republican architect of the tax plan in the house also scrambled to reassure critics that a rewrite would not undermine retirement savings all the focus is on can we help people save more he said yet for all the alarming rhetoric about crushed nest eggs there are a couple of things to keep in mind first the debate on capitol hill is not really about retirement it s about lawmakers feverish hunt for revenue to finance tax cuts second no matter what happens it won t solve the fundamental problem that many americans will outlive their savings there are several types of subsidized retirement accounts people who work at larger companies tend to set aside money in a 401k they don t pay taxes until they withdraw funds by contrast americans who open an account known as a roth get a different kind of break they pay tax on money before it is deposited but then get to withdraw it and the subsequent earnings taxfree in the future details of the republican tax plan have not yet been released but the talk has been of imposing a cap of 2400 a year on taxdeferred contributions to 401k plans a sharp reduction from the current ceiling of 18000 a year for people under 50 and 24000 for people age 50 and above advertisement continue reading the main story there would still be a tax benefit but it would probably be under a rothstyle structure to some people enjoying the break when they withdraw money instead of when they deposit it may not make a difference but for republicans in washington desperately seeking a fast boost in revenue timing is everything their tax bill includes giant reductions in business taxes figuring out how to pay for tax cuts is always a grueling task but it is especially complicated in today s bitterly partisan atmosphere republican lawmakers intend to push through a bill without any democratic support but there is a catch the singleparty strategy in this case triggers a rule that requires the policy to have no impact on the budget at the end of 10 years to make the math work lawmakers need to come up with the revenue to pay for the cuts sooner rather than later photo that s where 401k s come in rather than allow workers to continue delaying their tax payments the republican leadership wants to collect tax revenue on most new contributions upfront so they can use it to pay for those expensive corporate tax cuts that s the equivalent of a middleclass tax increase it s just an enormous budget gimmick said william gale of the nonpartisan tax policy center it s raiding future revenues to pay for current tax cuts this is not a retirement

matter taxsubsidized retirement accounts have long roused fans and critics budget cutters point to the trillions of dollars they cost the treasury department groups concerned about growing inequality complain that the tax break primarily benefits higherincome americans who would save for retirement anyway those with more modest salaries generally have less access to workbased plans or can t afford to save consumer advocates worry they are too vulnerable to the vagaries of the stock market still these retirement plans are extremely popular among middle and upperincome voters and many of the politicians who represent them which is why previous attempts to eliminate them have failed whether a taxdeferred 401k or a roth is a better deal is not clear younger workers starting out can reasonably assume they are in a lower tax bracket now and benefit from a roth while middleage workers may assume they will be in a lower bracket after they retire but mostly there are question marks who knows if congress will raise or lower tax rates 30 years from now or if someone will shift from a higher tax bracket to a lower one it wouldn t be the first time taxes on retirement income changed social security benefits were shielded from federal income taxes for decades before the law changed in 1983 advertisement continue reading the main story mr gale says he thinks the immediacy of the 401k tax break encourages people to save more than they otherwise might so does mr benna the 401k s inventor although he says the tax deferral alone without employers matching some of their employees contributions was probably insufficient to persuade lowerwage workers to participate it has nudged up middleclass savings it s harder to save the same amount after taxes he said there will be a dropoff in contributions but other experts aren t so sure andrew biggs formerly a principal deputy commissioner of the social security administration said that for most people it makes little difference whether they pay taxes on retirement savings now or in the future automatic enrollment and the employer matches are much more important than the delayed taxes said mr biggs now a retirement specialist at the conservative american enterprise institute some studies have confirmed his hunch one team of researchers looked at a handful of companies that offered a taxdeferred savings plan and then added a roth option to the menu they found the total amount of contributions didn t change much the tax deduction was a pretty minor force said james choi a finance professor at the yale school of management and a part of that team and depending on future tax law mr choi said that retirees with roth accounts could get by with smaller contributions than those with 401k s because they won t have to pay as much tax on the savings they withdraw the possibility that people may save less overall is fueling financial services industry opposition to the tax proposal currently in congress plan administrators which include major mutual fund companies like fidelity investments and vanguard group are paid a share of the assets under their control if the assets shrink so do their fees what worries mr choi though is the republicans idea to cap the amount of taxdeferred contributions at 2400 a year while treating the rest like roth contributions setting the cap there could drag down savings because people tend to interpret such thresholds as recommendations he said from that perspective it would be better to eliminate tax deferrals altogether rather than set such a low ceiling yet whether the 401k caps are untouched slashed or abandoned altogether the prospect remains that millions of americans will face retirement with no savings"

these are the prototypes for the border wall president trump has vowed to erect on the southern border later this year the federal government will test the panels for strength and effectiveness these prototypes make clear that a border wall is not simple it can vary considerably in material shape and cost and while it is far from clear that congress will pay for a wall or that any of these designs will be built at wider scale they are reallife renderings of a promise that fueled much of mr trump s campaign six contractors have made bids on the wall and the specific details of their plans are not public but they allowed us to visit the prototypes and we asked border security experts and engineers what they saw in each design and what challenges each wall may face every expert agreed on one thing finding a design that would work for the entire length of the border would be extremely hard if not impossible and many caution that such a wall may never happen concrete or no concrete concrete not concrete the prototypes include plain concrete walls and ones made of a combination of materials what the government described as other than concrete the term is intentionally vague a signal to contractors to be creative and bring a design that us customs and border protection had not considered any barrier must be able to withstand at least 30 minutes of force from a sledgehammer car jack pick axe chisel batteryoperated impact tools batteryoperated cutting tools oxyacetylene torch or other similar handheld tools according to the instructions for the prototypes some other than concrete prototypes incorporate steel which can be relatively easy to cut with a torch while pure concrete is not a hollow steel pipe whose walls are half an inch thick could easily be cut in less than an hour according to michael d engelhardt professor of structural engineering at the university of texas at austin steel is also malleable mr engelhardt said that a small hydraulic arm similar to the jaws of life used to pry open a crumpled car could easily be used to make an opening in such a wall the equipment is small could likely fit in a backpack inexpensive widely available and can generate many tons of force steel can rust really quickly said curtis patterson a structural engineer based in san diego who visited the prototypes with a team of times journalists he pointed to several rust spots that had already appeared on one of the prototypes less than a month after construction but some envision the mixedmaterial walls as having more technological capabilities they might be called smart walls walls that incorporate radar acoustics and other types of surveillance embedded in the infrastructure one of the contractors bidding on the wall is elta north america an israeli defense contractor that specializes in radar and communication equipment my sense is they will select multiple awards for these types of infrastructure said jayson ahern a former acting commissioner of customs and border protection who was involved in the construction of a border fence during the george w bush administration some will be for technology some for when they just need a wall opaque or transparent opaque transparent david aguilar a former deputy commissioner of customs and border protection said that with concerns over officer safety it is critical that border patrol agents have good situational awareness it can be done visually or it could be done with technology but in a highactivity area it is difficult to discern legal activity versus illegal in urban areas you re going to need that transparency in terms of attempted intrusion you want to see people coming toward the border so that they can respond michael evangelistaysasaga the chief executive of penna group which has contracted with the government before but whose prototype bid was rejected said a seethrough border wall allows them to know when they are facing threats on the other side which border patrol has long preferred on their wish list they didn t want a solid wall going through was never the real threat the real threat is going over or under big and beautiful more aesthetics fewer aesthetics mr trump campaigned on a big fat beautiful wall so it s unsurprising that looks play a role in the border wall guidelines the official proposal request says that the usfacing side of the wall should be aesthetically pleasing but standing in front of the prototypes mr patterson winced when he considered the aesthetics of a potential wall i don t know if there s a way to make these beautiful unless you get murals painted on them he said with a chuckle you want something that blends in that you wouldn t be offended to look at from your backyard some of the steel looks like something you d find in a prison the brick facade is more like something you d see on a freeway the only wall that actually has a brick facade is the prototype from texas sterling construction but in keeping with the guidelines the pattern appears only on the usfacing side what mexico gets to see is a bare concrete wall lined with barbed wire facing the united states facing mexico it turns out that barbed wire presents its own problems mr evangelistaysasaga said that his company often uses razor wire in prisons and that animals routinely get stuck for humans hair and clothing could get tangled in it having such wire along the border would be really inhumane he said you re going to read about a whole family dead on a sunday morning it s going to be a human rights nightmare in the international world precast or filled onsite precast filledin the engineers and contractors agree that concrete walls aren t the most complicated of structures to deal with for them the big question is do you make walls onsite or precast them lengthy wall segments in very remote regions can make pouring concrete onsite expensive and logistically difficult most experts thought that precasting making the concrete panels elsewhere and then shipping them to the border was the most practical choice rather than build from point a to point b the wall route could be divided into segments say 100 miles apart said daniel abrams a professor of structural engineering at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign tube or no tube tube no tube border patrol officials have repeatedly said that they want to construct a wall that would be effectively impossible to scale that it should be physically imposing measure between 18 and 30 feet high and include anticlimbing features many of the contractors added a rounded tube at the top of their prototypes they believe it will make it far less likely that anyone could reach the top it makes it impossible to straddle or use to get a rope ladder across because there is nothing to hook onto deputy chief patrol agent roy d villareal said"

the threatened obamaera program called deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca which protects young immigrants brought to the country as children it is na\u00efve for us to believe that we will get 12 republicans to vote for daca or the dream act without putting something on the table said senator richard j durbin of illinois an coauthor of the dream act which would offer a path to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants who arrived as children there s always going to be a group that wants more there are some people who want all or nothing democrats need to be mindful not just of white workingclass voters but all voters said cornell belcher who worked as one of president barack obama s pollsters during his 2008 presidential campaign democrats have to thread a fine needle he said because polls show that voters broadly feel as though their borders need to be more secure but activists worry that any compromise could carry a very personal price their own longterm safety might be secured only in exchange for an increased threat of deportation for their undocumented parents and friends who do not qualify for such protections under the program video that is a deal that many of them are not willing to take we are going to do whatever it takes to push both parties to pursue what we are demanding said cristina jim\u00e9nez executive director of united we dream we don t want a situation where my brother who has daca will have relief from deportation and we will have more enforcement and more ice agents who end up going after my mom and my dad the prospect of a strangebedfellows deal on one of the most contentious political issues of the last two decades emerged last month after mr trump and the two democrats dined at the white house the working dinner set the stage for an endoftheyear clash in congress over border security limits on immigration and the fate of the young immigrants known as dreamers advertisement continue reading the main story mr trump had announced an end to his predecessor s program before the dinner but his willingness to pursue a bipartisan legislative deal to enshrine the program into law set off a furious response from conservatives on television news programs that the president is known to watch that has made the legislative path forward far from certain mr trump is under pressure from inside and outside his administration to insist on an array of tough immigration control measures in exchange for what his supporters view as amnesty for the undocumented immigrants administration officials say he will soon release a set of principles that will guide his dealmaking with the democrats conservatives want those principles to include a call to limit the number of new legal immigrants and emphasize the entry of highskilled workers instead of the family members of immigrants already in the country they want to expand the everify system to ensure that businesses do not hire undocumented workers they are insisting on steppedup immigration enforcement throughout the country s interior and they want mr trump to get his wall along the southern border photo immigration activists reject such demands as meanspirited and too farreaching previous legislative efforts during the administrations of george w bush and mr obama considered that breadth of immigration enforcement but only in exchange for a path to citizenship for all 12 million of the undocumented immigrants in the country not the smaller pool of socalled dreamers those young immigrants and their allies say they will not accept what they consider draconian measures in exchange for a deal on daca or on the dream act the bill dating back to 2001 that would provide a pathway to citizenship for young immigrants brought in illegally as children i think senator schumer crumbles under pressure just so he can deliver on something said cesar adrian vargas an immigrantrights advocate and a daca recipient but the larger constellation of immigrantrights groups are divided veteran activists view the nocompromise strategy as shortsighted and unlikely to succeed while few said they were willing to work directly with mr trump the way they worked with mr bush during past immigration fights they also said they recognized the need to compromise janet murgu\u00eda president of unidosus formerly the national council of la

aides were during the legislative efforts to pass an immigration overhaul in 2006 and 2007 but immigration activists and lawmakers who went through those unsuccessful fights said they could not win without compromising that drama is likely to play out at the end of the year as lawmakers in both parties face a middecember deadline to fund the government and extend some popular initiatives like the children s health insurance program the expectation is that speaker paul d ryan of wisconsin and senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader will allow the immigration issue to be settled as part of the budget deal if that happens some immigration rights activists say democrats will have no choice but to accept some republican demands in exchange for legalizing the young immigrants democrats also must weigh the political risk of being seen as weak on security issues as they try to recover from their 2016 losses during the congressional black caucus foundation s annual conference last month kathleen wells a black radio host challenged several members of congress to explain why black americans should embrace allowing more immigrants to remain in the united states who

emphasizing that he was one of the lucky ones who is legally in the united states even as political leaders in houston sought to reassure residents that routine immigration enforcement would not be conducted at shelters and food banks many people fleeing their homes expressed dismay over what they described as mixed signals coming from immigration authorities in the upheaval around hurricane harvey the border patrol did not suspend operations at checkpoints in texas on saturday even after the storm unleashed destruction in parts of the state drawing sharp rebukes from human rights activists who said the decision put the lives of undocumented immigrants and mixedstatus families at risk the american civil liberties union said that maintaining the checkpoints stood in contrast to the position taken just last october by the border patrol during hurricane matthew when authorities explicitly said that there would be no immigration enforcement checkpoints officials with the border patrol sought to ease fears contending that the checkpoints in texas are set up south of areas affected by the storm but rights groups pointed out that many people in houston could potentially pass

supreme court the sb 4 issue is very real in our community and although sb 4 does not require any local official to check immigration status it certainly has created a climate of fear said geoffrey

how or if things will change after september 1 given the statewide effective date a lack of trust among immigrants has deepened since president trump was inaugurated in january and immigration arrests

senators who have been reluctant to support it like earlier repeal efforts the new plan would also repeal the individual mandate to purchase insurance and get rid of certain subsidies for outofpocket health expenses but the measure still has important differences from the three bills that failed to pass the senate in july and the one that passed the house in may and it is those differences that

introduced by senator bill cassidy of louisiana and senator lindsey graham of south carolina gives states sweeping discretion to come up with their own health care systems through federal block grants this would mean the biggest devolution of federal money and responsibility to states ever and the results would be very unpredictable said larry levitt a policy expert at the kaiser family foundation 1 states would get block grants in place of money for affordable care act programs the cassidygraham bill would repeal the expansion of medicaid coverage to poor adults and cancel subsidies that help middleincome americans afford insurance beginning in 2020 states would get block grants they could use to replicate the affordable care act programs if they wanted to or develop their own health care plans in the latest version of the cassidygraham bill states represented by senators who have been on the fence including alaska and maine would receive more money than under the current law how it compares no other republican plan called for replacing money for medicaid expansion and subsidies with lump sums to states under most of the earlier plans the way those programs are funded would have changed but the medicaid expansion and subsidies would not have been completely defunded lump sums were made available to the states in both the house bill and one of the earlier senate bills but the amounts were smaller and were intended to cover costs like premium increases that would result from repealing the individual mandate or creating highrisk pools impact the effects of the plan would depend entirely on what health insurance systems states decided to create but over all there would be less federal money to work with and states that have expanded coverage for more of their residents under the affordable care act would get less money under the plan while some states may use their block grants to replicate affordable care act programs or provide other forms of health insurance others may use the block grants to substitute for existing state spending instead of using it to offer health insurance to people covered under the affordable care act that choice could mean widely disparate outcomes in how many people retain coverage from state to state 2 states can set many of their own health insurance standards under the revised bill states would not have to preserve some of the affordable care act s insurance regulations if they did not want to states could for example decide to allow insurers to omit some of the benefits they are currently required to provide like coverage for maternity care mental health care and drug addiction treatment they could also let companies offer much skimpier plans experts say that the language in the bill is confusing and inconsistent but it appears that the revised bill would weaken the protections for people with preexisting conditions and allow insurers to charge higher prices based on a person s health status how it compares the cassidygraham bill proposes keeping the insurance market rules but asks states to waive them if they like by contrast one of the senate plans that failed to pass had proposed waiving the rules at the federal level but it would have allowed states to keep them if they liked the house bill had proposed allowing states to seek waivers for the regulations but also allowed for an 8 billion fund to help people with preexisting conditions impact under the plan people with preexisting conditions could be at risk of being priced out of the market because insurers in some states could charge them higher prices it is possible that even if they could afford insurance that the skimpier benefit rules would mean that their plan did not cover some of the services they needed republican leaders have repeatedly said that they would like to preserve protections for those with preexisting conditions president trump said that the cassidygraham bill would protect them but that would be true only in states that chose not to eliminate those rules 3 federal funding disappears in 2027 the state block grant program established under the bill would end after 2026 unless congress decided to renew it how it compares while previous bills proposed cuts and modifications to the affordable care act programs neither the house bill nor the earlier senate bills proposed letting the funding expire impact if congress did not renew the block grants tens of millions of people would lose health insurance because states would have to roll back coverage or replace federal dollars any new programs states created with the block grants would most likely end"

act has shifted the nation s baseline expectations for how health care should work its successes have pushed republican politicians like mr trump into making expansive promises to provide insurance to all americans its failures have become focal points too leading to calls for lower insurance deductibles and for more choices in doctors and hospitals since republicans took power public opinion has suddenly tipped in its favor for lots of people obamacare has become synonymous with the health care system itself with its many miracles and dysfunctions there are layers beneath each judgment of course the law was broad and complex with many goals and provisions this assessment touches on its largest achievements and its biggest disappointments for many important questions there is not yet strong evidence either way successes twenty million more people have health insurance providing health coverage to the uninsured was obamacare s principal goal and on that measure it has succeeded the gain of 20 million insured based on an obama administration estimate last year is probably now even higher not everyone shares the goal of expanded health coverage and some of those newly insured bristle under an individual mandate to have insurance or pay a fine still many of the newly insured could not have afforded insurance before the law passed or would have been shut out because of preexisting health conditions the rapid reduction in the number of uninsured americans has shifted the political debate about health reform in 2009 many republicans were comfortable with a status quo in which many americans couldn t get health care now mr trump and republican leaders in congress have said their plans could cover as many people as the affordable care act although a recent cbo

financial product intended to protect people from catastrophic bills if they are sick or injured it is still early to measure the health law s full impact but several studies have found that lowincome

insurance for those with low and middle incomes but it also raised taxes on high earners this mix of policies made the law controversial but it also furthered the obama administration s goals of narrowing the gap between rich and poor americans it made health insurance more comprehensive before obamacare many products could be called health insurance now health plans are required to cover services like maternity care and treatment for drug addiction and they can t cap how much they will pay in a given year many of the law s critics dislike its numerous coverage mandates but the new rules have increased patients access to services like mental health counseling contraception and cancer screenings it lowered the federal deficit obamacare was devised with a mix of new spending and taxes along with cuts to the federal medicare program so that it would save more than it cost a recent forecast from the congressional budget office estimates that if left in place the affordable care act will continue to save federal dollars through at least 2025 recent legislation has made some small changes to the law s tax provisions but analysts at the committee for a responsible federal budget ran the numbers again and found very little difference failures health insurance remains very expensive obamacare s marketplaces and medicaid expansion make health coverage a good deal for those near the poverty line but those earning not much more still often struggle to pay health plan premiums and face deductibles that are much higher than those seen in a typical employer health plan in the law s first three years premiums were lower than expected and grew slowly but prices shot up this year causing financial shocks for buyers who don t receive government help in paying their premiums several analysts believe the increases resulted from recent policy changes and toolow early pricing and may represent a onetime market correction insurers have also said that they have found the pool of obamacare enrollees to be sicker and less predictable in their health care needs than expected some people who earn enough to qualify for meager or no subsidies find health care unaffordable the health care system remains complex and confusing president barack obama has described the health law s markets as being like a kayak or an amazon for health insurance they re not health insurance is easier to shop for now but it remains a complicated and opaque product and selecting the right health plan is often frustrating or impossible for americans unsure of their health needs or unable to decode jargon like outofpocket maximum or innetwork provider after picking their insurance patients can still struggle to use it and can get stuck with surprise bills or long negotiations with their insurance companies photo in many parts of the country only one insurer even offers health plans limiting the choices available to consumers if you like your plan you can t always keep your plan the obamacare marketplaces are set up to encourage customers to frequently switch their health plans to avoid steep price increases the markets have also been turbulent with insurers going out of business exiting markets or shifting around their offerings each year that has led to a large fraction of renewing customers who change health plans every year unable to pick a plan they like and stick with it or your doctor many obamacare health plans trying to keep prices competitive have sharply limited the number of doctors or hospitals they will cover obamacare s authors did not expect socalled narrow network plans to become so widespread these have made it hard for some customers to find any plan that includes their favored providers and means that switching plans often means switching doctors too the narrower networks despite their inconveniences have helped keep insurance prices lower advertisement continue reading the main story too soon to tell we don t know if the law made america healthier health insurance is not the same thing as health and we still have very limited data about whether the law s coverage expansion has lengthened lives or improved their quality in meaningful ways there is some encouraging but very early evidence that lowincome people in two states that expanded medicaid reported improving overall health compared with their lowincome neighbors in a state that did not and there is research that more lowincome americans have visited a doctor and have received some basic preventive health services including prescription contraceptives and treatments for diabetes but it will probably take many more years before it is clear whether the law has been beneficial to public health or how large that effect may be even though the law allowed 20 million more people to get coverage that s a small fraction of the nation s population and it often takes years for health care services to result in measurable benefits it s unclear what the law has done to national health spending a crucial goal for mr obama was bending the cost curve and slowing the accelerating cost of health care in the united states growth in health spending has indeed slowed in the years since obamacare s passage but it is hard to untangle the effects of the health law from other forces affecting health spending including the great recession rising insurance deductibles and a slowdown in the development of new medical technologies the health law s most ardent champions including mr obama credit it for this change but many economists are uncertain whether the slowdown is a result of the law or a mere coincidence it may have improved the quality of care in hospitals the health law contained many provisions intended to make medical care safer and more evidencebased the health system is still often a dangerous place for patients but fewer are contracting infections in the hospital for example or leaving the hospital only to be readmitted in a few weeks some trends were underway before the health law passed so it is difficult to tease out how much change was caused by obamacare or would have happened anyway"

compromise it lets individual state governments decide whether they want to stick with obamacare or not which would mean that the law would remain intact in most blue states for the time being while redder states would have the opportunity to turn roughly the same amount of money 95 percent to a different end that end would look like one of the more plausible conservative alternatives to obamacare a subsidy to cover the cost of a catastrophic health insurance plan plus a directly funded health savings account to cover primary care this system could be layered on top of the existing medicaid expansion replacing only the obamacare subsidies and exchanges or it could replace the medicaid expansion as well offering the poor and near poor the same catastrophic insurance plus a subsidy as everyone else in the individual market either way the individual mandate would disappear but people would be autoenrolled in a catastrophic plan with the option to opt out meaning that coverage would be nearly universal thus fulfilling one of president trump s various promises even though its benefits would be less comprehensive than obamacare s taken as a whole this approach distills both the promise and the peril of conservative health care policy the promise is that by having people pay for more of their health care in cash and by giving them more freedom in what plans they re allowed to buy you would end up with less spending lower prices and less cost inflation and you wouldn t need the heavy innovationsquashing price controls that singlepayer systems use to get

existing problems would persist in the states where it continues but those problems the rise in premiums the fleeing insurers the risk of a death spiral downstream are not equally problematic in every state and they are not fiscally dangerous as yet on the scale that many conservatives initially feared as the conservative policy thinker yuval levin wrote late last year the striking thing about obamacare to date is how much smaller than expected its effect on the overall health care system has been fewer people are being insured on the exchanges than liberals hoped fewer employers are dumping highcost employees onto the exchanges than conservatives feared and as a result he writes the extremely serious problems we are seeing now are within the one system that obamacare created from scratch the exchange system that system may not survive and its condition has a lot to teach us about the problems with liberal health economics but it is a much smaller system than anyone thought it would be at this point about half the size that cbo projected so that the effects of any failure it suffers are likely to be more contained than anyone might have expected this containment means that conservatives have room and time to be more patient cautious and experimental than were the obama democrats before them if the obamacare exchanges aren t ultimately going to work out then allowing them to persist in liberal states while an alternative system gets set up in red states is a reasonable way to gradually transition from the liberal model toward the conservative one if the right s wonks are right about health policy the cassidycollins approach should gradually enable conservatives to prove it and if the right is wrong if its model doesn t match reality if people are simply miserable as health care consumers because the system has too much of friedman and not enough of burke well in that case both the country and conservatism will be better off if we learn that via a voter rebellion in 10 rightleaning states rather than through a much more widespread backlash against a nationwide healthinsurance failure which is something a president with a high selfregard and poor approval ratings might have a particular reason to avoid between this reasonable case and legislative reality of course falls a variety of shadows but more than for the various repealandreplace alternatives i m not so sure right now the cassidycollins compromise has few enthusiastic backers in a few months however it might turn into conservative health care reform s best hope"

well above the national average of 17 percent but the health care law has allowed selfemployed residents and owners of very small businesses to have insurance for the first time in years it s been good to have it said charles smith a lobsterman from jonesport whose wife and three teenagers were sporadically without insurance for years before the law ms collins has been a critic of the affordable care act since it was enacted she has cited the instability in the insurance markets the increasing costs of premiums especially in rural northern areas and the scarcity of health care facilities that accept the plans during the trump presidency she said the tension over access has been exacerbated by the administration s mixed messages on cost sharing the administration has wavered on whether to continue government payments to health insurance companies to offset their customers outofpocket medical expenses the uncertainty is extremely problematic said eric a cioppa the superintendent of the maine bureau of insurance who said carriers could not fix their rates without knowing the fate of those subsidies if they don t get a subsidy i fully expect doubledigit increases for three carriers on the exchanges here ms collins also said she would like to see a fix to the wage cliff in which a single dollar increase over the affordable care act s income threshold can cost a worker the full value of his insurance subsidy it is a special problem for seasonal workers whose incomes fluctuate throughout the year i really dislike that the law discourages work and pay raises she said maine has been viewed by republicans as a possible model for some reforms it was one of a handful of states that embraced a guaranteed issue policy of health insurance regardless of preexisting medical conditions and it created invisible highrisk pools to help sick people buy insurance and stabilize the markets photo republicans cite maine as the model for the risk pool in the house measure but ms collins notes that the house bill does not fund statebased risk pools anywhere near the level that maine has advertisement continue reading the main story one of the problems with the exchanges is that the pools are not large enough she said it would cost 15 billion annually to expand nationally a patient stability fund like maine did a state bill that loosened community rating rules and deregulated the insurance market could also be a model for a republican health care bill that allows states more waivers from federal rules many state health care experts see that as a way to get more flexibility and experimentation in insurance markets for instance ms collins thinks maine should embrace a medicaid expansion modeled on the one adopted by indiana after the state obtained a waiver from the obama administration indiana included managedcare plans in its medicaid expansion and a requirement that poor people contribute to savings accounts which are then applied to the portion of their medical bills maine also has one of the few viable health insurance cooperatives in the nation which was hugely popular but has struggled to stay solvent because of high health care costs for maine s newly insured it is on a better footing this year maine health care experts are watching ms collins carefully in the debate which republicans would like to see reach its climax before the july fourth recess i think she is very conscious of the fact that if you move forward with a plan that gives tax credits to higherincome people but not a 60yearold in presque isle that is not a good move for our state said emily brostek the executive director of consumers for affordable health care in augusta me rural maine voters who largely supported mr trump in his election are watching too i like what i ve got said mr smith the lobsterman who is an independent and voted for mr trump if they get rid of obamacare i would say i would blame the republicans"

                    "text": "a retirement crisis already looms three out of four americans worry that they will not have enough money to get through their retirements according to the national institute on retirement security about 45 percent have not saved a cent toward it mr trump sensitive to the firestorm that could be provoked by limits on 401k contributions tweeted that there would be no change to this great and popular middle class tax break before conceding it might be a part of legislative horsetrading representative kevin brady of texas the principal republican architect of the tax plan in the house also scrambled to reassure critics that a rewrite would not undermine retirement savings all the focus is on can we help people save more he said yet for all the alarming rhetoric about crushed nest eggs there are a couple of things to keep in mind first the debate on capitol hill is not really about retirement it s about lawmakers feverish hunt for revenue to finance tax cuts second no matter what happens it won t solve the fundamental problem that many americans will outlive their savings there are several types of subsidized retirement accounts people who work at larger companies tend to set aside money in a 401k they don t pay taxes until they withdraw funds by contrast americans who open an account known as a roth get a different kind of break they pay tax on money before it is deposited but then get to withdraw it and the subsequent earnings taxfree in the future details of the republican tax plan have not yet been released but the talk has been of imposing a cap of 2400 a year on taxdeferred contributions to 401k plans a sharp reduction from the current ceiling of 18000 a year for people under 50 and 24000 for people age 50 and above advertisement continue reading the main story there would still be a tax benefit but it would probably be under a rothstyle structure to some people enjoying the break when they withdraw money instead of when they deposit it may not make a difference but for republicans in washington desperately seeking a fast boost in revenue timing is everything their tax bill includes giant reductions in business taxes figuring out how to pay for tax cuts is always a grueling task but it is especially complicated in today s bitterly partisan atmosphere republican lawmakers intend to push through a bill without any democratic support but there is a catch the singleparty strategy in this case triggers a rule that requires the policy to have no impact on the budget at the end of 10 years to make the math work lawmakers need to come up with the revenue to pay for the cuts sooner rather than later photo that s where 401k s come in rather than allow workers to continue delaying their tax payments the republican leadership wants to collect tax revenue on most new contributions upfront so they can use it to pay for those expensive corporate tax cuts that s the equivalent of a middleclass tax increase it s just an enormous budget gimmick said william gale of the nonpartisan tax policy center it s raiding future revenues to pay for current tax cuts this is not a retirement

subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters the question of whether deferring taxes on retirement savings is actually good policy however is a separate matter taxsubsidized retirement accounts have long roused fans and critics budget cutters point to the trillions of dollars they cost the treasury department groups concerned about growing inequality complain that the tax break primarily benefits higherincome americans who would save for retirement anyway those with more modest salaries generally have less access to workbased plans or can t afford to save consumer advocates worry they are too vulnerable to the vagaries of the stock market still these retirement plans are extremely popular among middle and upperincome voters and many of the politicians who represent them which is why previous attempts to eliminate them have failed whether a taxdeferred 401k or a roth is a better deal is not clear younger workers starting out can reasonably assume they are in a lower tax bracket now and benefit from a roth while middleage workers may assume they will be in a lower bracket after they retire but mostly there are question marks who knows if congress will raise or lower tax rates 30 years from now or if someone will shift from a higher tax bracket to a lower one it wouldn t be the first time taxes on retirement income changed social security benefits were shielded from federal income taxes for decades before the law changed in 1983 advertisement continue reading the main story mr gale says he thinks the immediacy of the 401k tax break encourages people to save more than they otherwise might so does mr benna the 401k s inventor although he says the tax deferral alone without employers matching some of their employees contributions was probably insufficient to persuade lowerwage workers to participate it has nudged up middleclass savings it s harder to save the same amount after taxes he said there will be a dropoff in contributions but other experts aren t so sure andrew biggs formerly a principal deputy commissioner of the social security administration said that for most people it makes little difference whether they pay taxes on retirement savings now or in the future automatic enrollment and the employer matches are much more important than the delayed taxes said mr biggs now a retirement specialist at the conservative american enterprise institute some studies have confirmed his hunch one team of researchers looked at a handful of companies that offered a taxdeferred savings plan and then added a roth option to the menu they found the total amount of contributions didn t change much the tax deduction was a pretty minor force said james choi a finance professor at the yale school of management and a part of that team and depending on future tax law mr choi said that retirees with roth accounts could get by with smaller contributions than those with 401k s because they won t have to pay as much tax on the savings they withdraw the possibility that people may save less overall is fueling financial services industry opposition to the tax proposal currently in congress plan administrators which include major mutual fund companies like fidelity investments and vanguard group are paid a share of the assets under their control if the assets shrink so do their fees what worries mr choi though is the republicans idea to cap the amount of taxdeferred contributions at 2400 a year while treating the rest like roth contributions setting the cap there could drag down savings because people tend to interpret such thresholds as recommendations he said from that perspective it would be better to eliminate tax deferrals altogether rather than set such a low ceiling yet whether the 401k caps are untouched slashed or abandoned altogether the prospect remains that millions of americans will face retirement with no savings"
