The workers say they struggle to cover debts amassed in paying recruitment agents for their jobs, while confronting physical hardships and violations of their rights under local labor laws.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost of the workers interviewed by The Times have been employees of a local construction company, Al Arif, which has a contract from Damac to build parts of the course and surrounding villas at Damac Hills. They spoke on condition that they not be identified, citing risks they could be fired and deported, because their visas were sponsored by their employer.\n\nThere is no evidence that Mr. Trump is aware of the conditions for the workers employed by the contractor at his golf course. He has handed over management of his company to two of his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric. The Trump Organization\u2019s purview has been designing and managing the courses, leaving the construction to Damac.\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions, referring inquiries to the Trump Organization.\n\n\u201cTrump is not the owner or developer of Trump International Golf Club Dubai nor does it oversee construction or employ or supervise any of the companies or individuals who have been retained to work on the building of the project,\u201d said a company spokeswoman, Amanda Miller, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cTrump has a zero-tolerance policy,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cTo the extent any worker at the project believes they are being treated improperly, we would urge them to immediately notify their employer and the proper governmental authorities.\u201d\n\nDamac\u2019s senior vice president for marketing and corporate communications, Niall McLoughlin, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA receptionist at Al Arif Group in Dubai referred calls to the head of the company\u2019s immigration department, Aziz Dashti, and supplied a mobile telephone number. A man who answered the number initially confirmed that he was Mr. Dashti, and rejected claims of worker mistreatment. Later, he said he was not Mr. Dashti.",

The only avenues of growth currently, given the shutdown of so many coal-burning power plants in the United States, are markets overseas.\n\n\u201cTheir goal, in collusion with the environmentalists, was to drive us out of the export business,\u201d Mr. Reavey said.\n\nEven with the moves so far, the prospect of coal companies operating in a big way on federal land \u2014 and for any major job growth \u2014 is dim, in part because environmentalists have blocked construction of a coal export terminal, and there is limited capacity at the port the companies use in Vancouver.\n\nCompetition from other global suppliers offering coal to Asian power plants is also intense.\n\nBut at least for now, coal production and exports are rising in the Powder River Basin after a major decline last year.\n\nWestern Coal The majority of United States coal is produced in the West, with a small share of it then exported. About 85 percent of coal extracted from federal lands comes from the Powder River Basin, in Wyoming and Montana. The Trump administration is rolling back an Obama-era moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands.

New Mexico and California sued in April to undo the rollback in royalties that coal mines pay, while ranchers like Mr. Hayes and the Northern Cheyenne tribe joined a lawsuit in March challenging the repeal of a year-old moratorium on federal coal leasing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf we hand over control of these lands to a narrow range of special interests, we lose an iconic part of the country \u2014 and the West\u2019s identity,\u201d said Chris Saeger, executive director of the Montana-based environmental group Western Values Project, referring to coal mining and oil and gas drilling that the Interior Department is moving to rapidly expand.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s point man is Ryan Zinke, a native Montanan who rode a horse to work on his first day as head of the Interior Department. A former member of the Navy SEALs and Republican congressman, Mr. Zinke oversees the national park system, as well as the Bureau of Land Management, which controls 250 million acres nationwide, parts of which are used to produce oil, gas, coal, lumber and hay.\n\nIn late June, Mr. Zinke visited Whitefish, Mont., to attend a meeting of Western governors, where he vowed to find a balance between extracting commodities from federal lands and protecting them.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cOur greatest treasures are public lands,\u201d Mr. Zinke said in a speech. \u201cIt is not a partisan issue. It is an American issue.\u201d\n\nAfterward, protesters from the Sierra Club and other groups held a rally in the town square against the actions taken by Mr. Zinke during his first months on the job, chanting \u201cShame!\u201d and \u201cLiar!\u201d and carrying signs opposing his policies.\n\nBut Mr. Zinke was not in public view. Just before the rally started, he was inside a nearby building, meeting with Bill Cadman, a vice president of Whiting Petroleum, a company that drills on federal lands.\n\nUntil recently a state legislator in Colorado, Mr. Cadman has lobbied the Interior Department to repeal a rule that limits methane emissions from oil and gas sites on federal land. As he left the brief gathering, Mr. Cadman said he was only catching up with Mr. Zinke, whom he has known for decades, on family-related matters. He also acknowledged that Mr. Zinke wielded a lot of power over the energy industry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are all affected by this constant regulatory quagmire,\u201d Mr. Cadman said.\n\nSeeing a Liberal Attack\n\nCloud Peak Energy had been preparing for several years to seize upon the arrival of an industry-friendly administration in Washington. But it was also prepared to fight without one.\n\nAt a gathering of a coal industry trade group in 2015, Mr. Reavey, the company\u2019s chief lobbyist, left no doubts about the company\u2019s determination to defend mining in the Powder River Basin, which includes operations here in Decker.\n\nMr. Reavey likened the industry\u2019s existential crisis to that of tobacco companies in the 1990s. The coal industry, he told executives, had been targeted by a liberal conspiracy of environmental groups, news organizations and regulators. Coal would suffer the same fate as cigarettes, he warned, unless the industry stood its ground.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe showed a PowerPoint slide that outlined the strategy of the industry\u2019s opponents. They sought to diminish coal\u2019s \u201csocial acceptability,\u201d the slide showed, while also cutting \u201cprofits through massive increase in regulation\u201d and reduced \u201cdemand/market access.\u201d He equated the situation to a scene in the film \u201cIndependence Day\u201d in which the American president asks the alien invaders, \u201cWhat is it you want us to do?\u201d An alien replies, \u201cDie.\u201d\n\nDuring President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, the coal industry\u2019s chief antagonist was Sally Jewell, a former oil industry engineer appointed Interior secretary in 2013. Ms. Jewell, an avid hiker, had also served as chief executive of the outdoor gear company REI.\n\nShe saw mining companies as a particular problem because they too often left behind polluted mine pits and paid too little for coal leases on federal land.\n\nStarting two years ago, Ms. Jewell took a series of steps to change the relationship between coal companies and the federal government. She imposed a moratorium on new federal coal leases while beginning a three-year study of the industry\u2019s environmental consequences. More than 40 percent of all coal mined in the United States comes from federal land, and when burned it generates roughly 10 percent of the country\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition, she called for greater transparency in the awarding of coal leases, and she backed an increase in the royalty payments made to operate coal mines on public lands.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe corruption in the coal sector is just so rampant,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nA central problem, she said, was the lack of competitive bidding for mining leases: Only 11 of the 107 sales of federal coal leases between 1990 and 2012 received more than one bid, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. A second study, by a nonprofit think tank, estimated that the practice had shortchanged taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.\n\nAnother hot-button issue was how much to charge in royalties, which generate about $1 billion a year for the federal government.\n\nUnder federal rules adopted in 1920, coal companies are required to pay \u201cnot less than\u201d 12.5 percent on sales of surface coal mined on federal lands. But for years, studies indicate, the companies paid far less \u2014 as little as 2.5 percent of the ultimate sale price \u2014 because they often negotiated large royalty discounts with sympathetic federal officials. Companies also often sell coal first to a corporate affiliate at a sharply reduced price, before reselling it to the intended customer, costing the government a chunk of its royalties, according to the Government Accountability Office study. The technique was particularly popular among mines with foreign buyers.",

        "text": "For two evenings during the first week in August, that was Eric Trump, the main attraction in the lobby and one of two Trump sons overseeing the president\u2019s real estate empire. Seated at a table facing the lobby entrance, Mr. Trump\u2019s presence caused a stir. Bystanders craned their necks to get a good look. A waiter shattered a glass. Another waiter spilled a glass of water on this reporter\u2019s purse.\n\nMr. Trump shook hands, accepted confections from dessert-bearing chefs \u2014 no lollipop trees, though \u2014 and took selfies. At one point, a man approached Mr. Trump and persuaded him to move to a spot near the bar, where several other men had requested a picture-taking session.\n\n\u201cThese are true loyalists,\u201d the man said as he took the real estate scion\u2019s elbow.\n\nAmid the din, Trump associates relaxed at separate tables. Carlos Gimenez Jr., a lawyer and sometime lobbyist who worked for the Trump Organization, watched the scene unfold as he ate shrimp cocktail and drank vodka martinis with a Tampa socialite, Jill Kelley, who was part of the drama that led to the resignation of David H. Petraeus as C.I.A. director in 2012.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very generous with his time,\u201d Mr. Gimenez said after he approached Eric Trump to say hello.\n\nHolding court on a blue velvet sofa some yards away was Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s digital strategist. Mr. Parscale spends a couple of evenings a week at the hotel \u2014 no discounts, he said \u2014 meeting with vendors or keeping an eye on the journalists who circulate the room.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take my wife on a date there,\u201d Mr. Parscale said later. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit around and just talk.

In an email sent after his visit, he said that greeting everyone, including supporters and reporters who interrupt his macaroni and cheese, is just part of the family business.\n\n\u201cAs to being approachable,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, \u201cI am always happy to take a picture with a fan or a guest \u2014 aside from being a kind person, we are in the hospitality industry and a warm and friendly environment is really the core of our business and who we are as a family.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Painter and other ethics experts say that is the gist of the problem \u2014 the hotel\u2019s political appeal has turned it into one giant lily pad where tourists, lobbyists and foreign leaders can schmooze and win favor with Trump loyalists.\n\nAccording to federal documents reviewed by The Washington Post, hotel guests spent an average of $652.98 a night, one of the highest rates in Washington, and contributed to the roughly $2 million in profit the Trump Organization made from the hotel during the first four months of this year.\n\nSome members of the Republican Party are happy to pump money into the business. According to recent Federal Election Commission filings, at least 22 Republican political campaigns have spent money at the hotel on lodging, food and event expenses since Mr. Trump was inaugurated.\n\nJennifer Watson, the chief of staff for Representative Tom Rice, Republican of South Carolina, said the congressman\u2019s re-election campaign spent $1,200 on catering for an event at BLT Prime because of the appeal of a new steakhouse in a historic building. It was not, she said, because it was part of the Trump empire.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see Trump, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the draw,\u201d Ms. Watson said of the president. \u201cIt\u2019s a new venue, and people want to try it.\u201d\n\nOthers say they visit because they hold political views that are unpopular in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a safe zone for Trump supporters,\u201d said Rudy Pamintuan, a Chicago-based consultant. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about strangers coming up and saying anything negative to you.\u201d\n\nLinger long enough in the lobby, late enough at night, and you will almost always see the safe zone in action.",

Most of the sales now are to tourists who make the shop one of the few places in New York City where one can find almost unanimous devotion to the president.\n\n\u201cThis is Trump world,\u201d said Mr. Sewani, an Indian immigrant. \u201cThe tourists love him. They think he\u2019s a god.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring Mr. Trump\u2019s recent stay in the Tower, access to the building was tightened as protesters gathered outside, and business suffered, said Mr. Sewani, who is a Trump supporter but seems less interested in Mr. Trump\u2019s controversial policies and statements than in the president\u2019s effects on gift sales.\n\nNext door to the newsstand is a small kiosk that sells official Trump-branded merchandise: higher-end offerings, like cuff links and sweaters.\n\nThe only claim of authenticity Mr. Sewani makes on his own merchandise \u2013 which he buys from the least expensive wholesalers he can find \u2013 is that he sells it at \u201cthe source.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the key,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople know that if it comes from Trump Tower, it\u2019s genuine.\u201d\n\nAnd while the kiosk selling the official stuff was quiet on Sunday, customers thronged Mr. Sewani\u2019s store, which he attributed to the bargains he offers, like the more affordable tchotchkes displayed amid deodorants and cold medicines. Above the M&M\u2019s and Twizzlers were some \u201cComb Trump\u201d fridge magnets ($9.99 each), with shocks of yellow hair. Near the lottery machine were Trump commemorative coins and key chains. Coffee mugs were going for $19.99, and the top sellers, the T-shirts, were $20.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Sewani said he grew up near Mumbai in a wealthy family. His father was a coal distributor who later invested in real estate. Mr. Sewani studied to be a civil engineer and in the mid-1980s met his wife through a newspaper advertisement seeking suitors for an arranged marriage.\n\n\u201cShe got 101 responses and chose me,\u201d he said. They married two weeks after they met and moved to New York City. Mr. Sewani soon invested in a stationery store in a Manhattan commercial building, the first of the two dozen he said he now owns.\n\nPhoto\n\nSince Mr. Trump\u2019s election, he said, the Trump Tower location, where he now spends most of his time, is his most profitable by far.\n\nMr. Sewani said his attempt to stock Trump-themed souvenirs in his other stores backfired because of the president\u2019s unpopularity in New York. After customers began boycotting his stores, he removed the merchandise.\n\nAt Trump Tower, Mr. Sewani patterns his salesmanship style after Mr. Trump\u2019s own, bargaining with customers and talking them into bigger purchases. For each customer who chose a $20 baseball cap recently, Mr. Sewani offered three for $50.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he was finally taken to the 26th floor to meet Mr. Trump, who offered him a slight reduction.\n\nMr. Sewani said he got to know Mr. Trump further during Mr. Trump\u2019s regular visits to the newsstand to buy rolls of Rolo candy. In 2015, Mr. Sewani emailed him, predicting that Mr. Trump would successfully run for president, and offered his campaign assistance. In return, he received an autographed printout of the email.\n\nRecent criticism of the president has not shaken Mr. Sewani\u2019s loyalty, he said.\n\n\u201cI still believe he will bring the country and the world to the next level,\u201d he said. Mr. Sewani pulled out a copy of a recent letter on White House letterhead that promised him \u201cdue consideration for positions appropriate for your broad range of experience.\u201d\n\nHe said he would love to be a diplomat in South Asia and would gladly leave his business behind and serve America, \u201cjust like Mr. Trump did.\u201d\n\nIf not, he will continue to sell Trump merchandise.\n\n\u201cHopefully, he will serve for eight years,\u201d he said. \u201cBusiness will keep booming and I can retire early.\u201d",

Investigators want to know whether anyone on Mr. Trump\u2019s team was part of that process.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Sater, a Russian immigrant, said he had lined up financing for the Trump Tower deal with VTB Bank, a Russian bank that was under American sanctions for involvement in Moscow\u2019s efforts to undermine democracy in Ukraine. In another email, Mr. Sater envisioned a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Moscow.\n\n\u201cI will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,\u201d Mr. Sater wrote.\n\nMr. Sater said he was eager to show video clips to his Russian contacts of instances of Mr. Trump speaking glowingly about Russia, and said he would arrange for Mr. Putin to praise Mr. Trump\u2019s business acumen.\n\n\u201cIf he says it we own this election,\u201d Mr. Sater wrote. \u201cAmericas most difficult adversary agreeing that Donald is a good guy to negotiate.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence in the emails that Mr. Sater delivered on his promises, and one email suggests that Mr. Sater overstated his Russian ties. In January 2016, Mr. Cohen wrote to Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, asking for help restarting the Trump Tower project, which had stalled. But Mr. Cohen did not appear to have Mr. Peskov\u2019s direct email, and instead wrote to a general inbox for press inquiries.\n\nThe project never got government permits or financing, and died weeks later.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, the Trump Organization has never had any real estate holdings or interests in Russia,\u201d the Trump Organization said Monday in a statement. Mr. Trump, however signed a nonbinding \u201cletter of intent\u201d for the project in 2015. Mr. Cohen said he discussed the project with Mr. Trump three times.\n\nThe Trump Organization on Monday turned over emails to the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election and whether anyone in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was involved. Some of the emails were obtained by The Times.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe emails obtained by The Times do not include any responses from Mr. Cohen to Mr. Sater\u2019s messages.\n\nIn a statement on Monday that was also provided to Congress, Mr. Cohen suggested that he viewed Mr. Sater\u2019s comments as puffery. \u201cHe has sometimes used colorful language and has been prone to \u2018salesmanship,\u2019\u201d the statement said. \u201cI ultimately determined that the proposal was not feasible and never agreed to make a trip to Russia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe emails obtained by The Times make no mention of Russian efforts to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign or the hacking of Democrats\u2019 emails. Mr. Trump, who began praising Mr. Putin years before the presidential campaign, has said there was no collusion with Russian officials. Previously released emails, however, revealed that his campaign was willing to receive damaging information about Mrs. Clinton from Russian sources.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The two men have spent decades operating in the world of New York commercial real estate, where the sources of funding can be murky.\n\nThrough his lawyer, Mr. Sater declined on Monday to address why he thought the deal would be a political win for Mr. Trump. He said he brought the project to Mr. Cohen in late 2015, but that he was not working for the Trump Organization and \u201cwould not have been compensated\u201d by them.\n\n\u201cDuring the course of our communications over several months, I routinely expressed my enthusiasm regarding what a tremendous opportunity this was for the Trump Organization,\u201d Mr. Sater said.\n\nMr. Sater was a broker for the Trump Organization for several years, typically paid to deliver real estate deals. A company he worked for, Bayrock, played a role in financing the Trump SoHo Hotel in New York. Mr. Sater and Mr. Cohen even worked together on a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia that they sought to get in front of Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser earlier this year.\n\nAs a broker for the Trump Organization, Mr. Sater had an incentive to overstate his business-making acumen. He presents himself in his emails as so influential in Russia that he helped arrange a 2006 trip that Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, took to Moscow.\n\n\n\n\u201cI arranged for Ivanka to sit in Putins private chair at his desk and office in the Kremlin,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Trump said she had no involvement in the discussions about the Moscow deal other than to recommend possible architects. In a statement, she said that during the 2006 trip she took \u201ca brief tour of Red Square and the Kremlin\u201d as a tourist. She said it is possible she sat in Mr. Putin\u2019s chair during that tour but she did not recall it. She said she has not seen or spoken to Mr. Sater since 2010. \u201cI have never met President Vladimir Putin,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Times reported earlier this year on the plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow, which never materialized. On Sunday, The Washington Post reported the existence of the correspondence between Mr. Sater and Mr. Cohen, but not its content.\n\nSpokespeople for the House Intelligence Committee had no comment on the documents.\n\nMr. Cohen has denied any wrongdoing, and the Trump Organization turned over the emails to the House as part of his ongoing cooperation with the investigation.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Stephen M. Ryan, wrote a letter to congressional investigators that contained what he said was a point-by-point refutation of a dossier suggesting that Mr. Cohen colluded with Russian operatives. That dossier, compiled by a retired British spy and briefed to Mr. Trump during the transition, was published online early this year.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe that the committee should give credence to or perpetuate any of the allegations relating to Mr. Cohen unless the committee can obtain independent and reliable corroboration,\u201d Mr. Ryan wrote.",

        "text": "Photo\n\nThese are dangerous days for Stephen Bannon, President Trump\u2019s brain. A new book about the White House chief strategist portrays the president as the empty vessel into which Mr. Bannon poured his ideology and agenda, propelling the two of them into the White House. The book, \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency,\u201d by Joshua Green, a reporter who has known Mr. Bannon for years, is a best seller that gives Mr. Trump second billing. That\u2019s made the empty vessel very angry.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s White House is drifting so dangerously that we find ourselves searching for ballast in unlikely places. There\u2019s Jeff Sessions, who refused to resign his post as attorney general amid daily humiliations. The new chief of staff, John Kelly, got off to a good start by arranging the sacking of Anthony Scaramucci, the inept and mercifully short-lived communications director.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s \u2014 ready for this? \u2014 Mr. Bannon, the alt-right ideologue who\u2019s emerged as one of the steadier hands on the ship. During the bile-filled, Breitbart-fueled campaign, Mr. Bannon encouraged Mr. Trump, who called him \u201cmy Steve,\u201d to toss all convention overboard. Now, while Mr. Trump tweets and rages, and drifts aimlessly from one policy to the next, Mr. Bannon keeps a whiteboard in his office war room with a handwritten list of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises. Not many of these promises have been checked off. But what\u2019s interesting is that Mr. Bannon is keeping such a list, and while it\u2019s easy to disagree with a lot of the items on it, he at least seems to represent fealty to what Trump voters said they wanted.\n\nHe also seems, at times, a voice for sanity, although in the Trump White House that\u2019s a relative term. He objected to Mr. Trump\u2019s untimely firing of James Comey, the F.B.I. director; warned Mr. Trump against continuing his abusive campaign against Mr. Sessions; and opposed Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s appointment, saying Mr. Trump needed a professional, not another inexperienced loyalist, to guide a press shop whose \u201cmessaging\u201d consists mostly of post-tweet babble.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

In the White House he may be their only advocate.\u201d",

        "text": "It was truly a scene at that time, often set to music by Robert John Burck, a. k. a. the Naked Cowboy, a fervent supporter of Mr. Trump. Mr. Burck and I have chatted at the Trump Grill in the lobby, where he sits in his spangled underwear taking a cocktail break with his wife, Patricia Cruz, who immigrated to America illegally from Mexico and is also a Trump supporter.\n\nSome of the building\u2019s upstairs spaces are open to the public, too, part of a public-private open space agreement Mr. Trump made with the city that designates the upper-floor terraces as public parks. They are grim, slate-colored spaces. At times protesters have assembled in them to mock Mr. Trump on his own home turf.\n\nBut there are a fair share of Trump fans in the lobby and on the lower levels, ordering dishes like Trump\u2019s Mother\u2019s Meatloaf in the food court and buying up \u201cMake America Great\u201d hats and bars of fake gold bullion. A clerk at an official shop there once told me \u201ceverything is made in America,\u201d which was inaccurate: Turning over cuff links and ties revealed they bore tags from places like Lesotho, China and Mexico.\n\nIn New York City, it is easy to find people who did not vote for Mr. Trump. For a balance of perspectives in my stories about Mr. Trump and the city, the lobby is a fertile place to find the people who support him. They typically are visitors from out of town wandering past the fountain that sheets down a wall and taking selfies.\n\nSometimes his supporters are reluctant to speak to me, affected by the president\u2019s diatribes that falsely accuse reporters across the board of pushing an anti-Trump agenda. To break the ice with people who express that opinion, I sometimes introduce myself as a \u201cfake news reporter,\u201d which gets a laugh. The way to get skeptical people to speak to me in the lobby is the same way reporters get people to speak to us always \u2014 with the truth. Here is your opportunity to express your perspective, I say; why not use it?\n\nOn the street, when Mr. Trump is not in town, things are considerably calmer than they were last year after the election. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen the men who sell pins of Mr. Trump shaped like a pile of dog droppings \u2014 one of whom wears a plush hat in the same shape \u2014 or the man who sells books lampooning President Barack H. Obama as a Doctor Seuss character.\n\nBusiness is almost back to normal at the restaurants on 56th Street by the tower. They suffered huge losses after Nov. 8 when police checkpoints blocked the streets for a time. I take the temperature of the economic climate there with frequent check-ins at Il Tinello, an Italian restaurant. The owner, John Goci, an immigrant who says he finds Mr. Trump\u2019s policies offensive, lost 30 percent of his business because of the road closures in the months after the election. Mr. Goci is like a man who has gone through all the stages of grief: When we first met he was initially infuriated at his neighbor, then distraught. These days, when I call up, he sighs with resignation.\n\nThat all could change with Mr. Trump back in town. My inbox is full of messages from anti-Trump groups notifying me that they have a rally scheduled or a protest march in the works. They could be big. At one rally before Inauguration Day, Cher showed up, and I was more than a little star-struck.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMostly, covering Mr. Trump and the city is about regular people navigating an unusual presidency. He may not be here much, but Mr. Trump and his tower, I have found, cast a very long shadow across the City of New York.",

The \u201csale that never occurred,\u201d as Mr. Trump called it in \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d was \u201cthe one that most helped Trump Tower.\u201d\n\nTrump Tower, at 721-725 Fifth Avenue, opened to the public on Feb. 14, 1983, when the man who would become the 45th president was in his first flush of flame. It was 58 stories, but that didn\u2019t stop the developer from promoting it as a 68-story building, to the chagrin of its chief architect, Der Scutt. The first 19 floors housed commercial enterprises; the first residential floor, the 20th, is listed as the 30th.\n\nWith its grand atrium, made largely of Italian Brecchi Perniche marble, and with retail tenants that eventually included Gucci, Landau jewelry and the Trump Store, the building is not exactly homey. \u201cWhen we were there, most people seemed to own more as an investment,\u201d said Marina Fareed, who lived there recently with her husband, Qazi Shaukat Fareed, a Pakistani diplomat. \u201cIt was not full-time people.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe completion of a grand tower in Midtown\u2019s high-end retail district cemented Mr. Trump\u2019s status as a force to be reckoned with in New York while also setting him apart from his father, the developer Fred C. Trump, who made his fortune with an empire of middle-class housing units in boroughs outside Manhattan.\n\n\u201cNot many sons have been able to escape their fathers,\u201d Donald Trump told The New York Times in 1983.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUntil he moved into the White House in January, he made his home in the building. His primary residence was a three-story penthouse apartment estimated at more than 10,000 square feet by Forbes. Originally designed by Halston\u2019s interior designer, Angelo Donghia, it had a smoky Helmut Newton vibe, with black lacquered walls, velvet furniture and handsome midcentury tables. A private elevator connected Mr. Trump to the 26th-floor office where he conducted Trump Organization business.\n\nThen Mr. Trump went to the nearby Olympic Tower for a dinner held by the Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi, encountered a living room bigger than his own and decided to remodel.\n\nOut went the mirrors, brass and mahogany. In came the Greek columns, gold leaf paint and Louis XIV-inspired furniture.\n\nFor the rest of the go-go 1980s, Mr. Trump lived in that airy show palace with his wife, Ivana, and their children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric. In the 1990s, after a tabloid divorce and a wedding at the nearby Plaza hotel attended by Howard Stern and O. J. Simpson, he was joined by his second wife, Marla Maples, and their daughter, Tiffany.\n\nIn 2001, two years after his divorce from Ms. Maples, Melania Knauss moved in. She and Mr. Trump were married in 2005, and their son, Barron, was given a floor of his own, with quarters for his mother and a nurse, after he came along in 2006. (Mrs. Trump and Barron made the White House their new home in June.)\n\nThe plan for a gleaming tower in place of the 12-story Bonwit Teller store, a stately structure built as Stewart & Company in 1929, was hatched in 1978. At the time, Mr. Trump was renovating the old Hotel Commodore, which became the Grand Hyatt, near Grand Central Terminal. The work on Trump Tower began in 1980, and its namesake developer was soon revealed to be someone who did not mind playing the villain.\n\nAfter he declared his intention to donate the building\u2019s pair of two-ton limestone relief panels of dancing women to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which wanted them for its sculpture collection, work crews instead demolished them, resulting in a torrent of negative publicity. Edward I. Koch, then the city\u2019s mayor, lambasted Mr. Trump for \u201cignoring the interests of the city.\u201d In an editorial, The Times said he seemed to be in a race \u201cto win a stupendous new unpopularity prize.\u201d\n\nNever one to apologize, Mr. Trump told New York magazine that all the negative publicity had only helped him sell more units. \u201cIt was fantastic promotion,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe demolition crew included undocumented Polish laborers, which kept costs down but subjected Mr. Trump to litigation. The contractor for the job of razing the Bonwit Teller building, William Kaszycki, of Kaszycki and Sons Contractors, ultimately served time in a New Jersey prison for employing illegal immigrants on another project. After a legal battle lasting many years, a federal judge found that Mr. Trump, a group of his associates and a union official had conspired to avoid making payments to the Housewreckers\u2019 Local 95 union.\n\nBy the time Trump Tower opened, more than half the building\u2019s condominium units had been sold, and all but a small percentage would be gone within the next few years. Paul Goldberger, then The Times\u2019s architecture critic, whom Mr. Trump had once called \u201can idiot,\u201d sounded amazed by how much he actually liked it.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIf overbearing publicity and overdressed guards do not a good building make, neither do they a good building deny,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTrump Tower,\u201d he added, \u201cis turning out to be a much more positive addition to the cityscape than the architectural oddsmakers would have had it.\u201d\n\nThree years after the building\u2019s opening, The Times reported that it had \u201cturned out to be a gold mine, with economics as glittery as the building itself.\u201d\n\nFew residents garnered as much publicity for the building as Michael Jackson, who for 10 months around 1994 rented a duplex apartment near the top and turned one of the bedrooms into a mirrored dance studio.\n\nMr. Trump made Mr. Jackson\u2019s acquaintance in 1988, when he attended a Madison Square Garden concert that was part of the singer\u2019s tour in support of his \u201cBad\u201d album. After the show, he made a backstage visit.\n\nIn 1990, Mr. Trump persuaded Mr. Jackson to show up at the opening of the Trump Taj Majal in Atlantic City, parading him in front of camera crews and reporters. The next day, Mr. Jackson\u2019s friend Ryan White died of AIDS, and the developer accompanied him on a visit to the grieving family in Indianapolis, bringing along a journalist to document the deed.\n\nAfter Mr. Jackson moved into his Trump Tower apartment, Mr. Trump took him to a low-key dinner at Le Cirque. \u201cThere was no entourage, no posse,\u201d said Mario Wainer, the restaurant\u2019s longtime ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel. \u201cHe came as a guest of Mr. Trump, and that was it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Jackson barely touched his risotto, Mr. Wainer recalled, and Mr. Trump had fish and drank no alcohol.\n\nGiven Mr. Trump\u2019s feuds with celebrities such as Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Snoop Dogg, it may not come as a surprise that some of his relationships with well-known tenants ended poorly.\n\nJohnny Carson left the building in 1987 after an episode with Mr. Trump over a missing vicuna coat: The talk show host accused two Trump employees of stealing it and demanded that they be fired. Mr. Trump went along with the request, only to hear back from Mr. Carson after he had found the coat.\n\nA few years later, Mr. Trump traded insults with the singer and actress Pia Zadora during a dispute with her husband, the dime-store magnate Meshulam Riklis, who rented office space in the building.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump sued Mr. Riklis for $1.2 million, charging nonpayment of rent, Ms. Zadora, who had been performing at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, called the lawsuit a publicity stunt. Mr. Trump hit back, telling a reporter, \u201cIf she were better looking and had a lot more talent, maybe she could at least partially sell out some of her Atlantic City dates.\u201d\n\nLater, when Ms. Zadora heard Mr. Trump using similar language in his feuds with Megyn Kelly and Ms. O\u2019Donnell, she realized \u2014 as she said in an interview last week \u2014 \u201cI was a pioneer!\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Mr. Trump wrote in his 1987 best seller, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d \u201cthe cycles of buyers at Trump Tower were always something of a barometer of what was going on in the international economy.\u201d\n\nThe first group, Mr. Trump wrote in the book, included many people hailing from the Middle East, some of them from nations the newly elected president would later seek to put on a travel ban list. There have also been residents of Mexico, a country Mr. Trump targeted through his candidacy. Juan Beckmann Vidal, who has a majority stake in Jose Cuervo Tequila, purchased and combined three units on the 31st floor in 2007.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll along, there has been a strong European contingent. Gianna Lahainer-Lombardi, a Palm Beach socialite originally from Trieste, Italy, lives in a duplex on the 62nd and 63rd floors with her second husband, George Guido Lombardi, who has described himself as an \u201cunofficial representative\u201d of Italy\u2019s anti-immigrant Northern League.\n\nIn January, Mr. Lombardi, who is suspicious of Islam, open borders and the European Union, held a cocktail reception in honor of Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s National Front party, at his apartment. The next day, he took her for a very public cup of coffee in the Trump Tower cafe.\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump called himself \u201cthe law and order candidate\u201d in 2016, his namesake tower has been welcoming to those who have run afoul of the law.\n\n\u201cCriminals got to go somewhere,\u201d said Robby Browne, a broker at the Corcoran Group.\n\nJoseph Weichselbaum, an executive at a helicopter company that flew gamblers to Trump-run casinos in Atlantic City, knew Mr. Trump well. His firm also took care of Mr. Trump\u2019s $10 million Super Puma helicopter.\n\nAfter being charged with drug trafficking, Mr. Weichselbaum rented an apartment owned by Mr. Trump himself at the Trump Plaza building on East 61st Street. Mr. Trump wrote a letter on his behalf to the presiding judge in the case, calling him a \u201ccredit to the community\u201d shortly before Mr. Weichselbaum pleaded guilty and was given a three-year sentence.\n\nIn 1990, after serving his time at Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Weichselbaum moved into adjoining apartments on the 49th floor of Trump Tower that had been purchased by the woman he was with at the time. He moved out of the building in 1994 and has not had legal troubles since then.\n\nAnother notorious resident was Jean-Claude Duvalier, the former Haitian dictator overthrown in a 1986 popular uprising, who owned a $2.5 million condominium through a Panamanian holding company.\n\nIn 1988, Jay Weinberg, a New York-bred career criminal, moved into Unit 63-A while under indictment for running what prosecutors said was the largest Medicaid fraud in history. After being convicted of using his low-cost, Brooklyn-based medical clinic to improperly bill Medicaid for $16 million in fees from 381,000 appointments that never took place, he was sentenced to seven to 21 years in prison. As prosecutors noted, he was literally robbing the poor to feed the rich.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Weinberg wouldn\u2019t even be the only convict who obtained keys to that particular unit. In 2009, it sold to Vadim Trincher, a Russian-born poker champion, for $5 million. In 2013, Mr. Trincher was convicted of running a gambling ring catering to Russian mobsters and sentenced to five years.\n\nHelly Nahmad, an art dealer who owns six apartments on the 51st floor of Trump Tower, pleaded guilty to a federal gambling charge of running a related ring with Mr. Trincher\u2019s son Illya Trincher, who was also convicted.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAt least Mr. Nahmad and Mr. Trincher have not been charged in connection with anyone\u2019s death, a dubious distinction held by Isaac Chehebar, a real estate investor and scion of the 1,300-store Rainbow retail chain.\n\nIn 2001, Mr. Chehebar was 20 years old and driving a friend\u2019s Porsche when he struck and killed Inna Shetman, 15, and her sister, Svetlana, 10. While Mr. Chehebar was under indictment, his family donated $80,000 to the re-election campaign of the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, whose office prosecuted the case.\n\nMr. Chehebar served a four-and-a-half-month sentence for criminally negligent homicide. In 2006, Mr. Chehebar spent $4.3 million for a 2,200-square-foot apartment on the 42nd floor of Trump Tower, property records show.\n\nSteven Hoffenberg, who was convicted in 1997 of bilking investors of Towers Financial Corporation of $462 million, leased office space on the 16th floor shortly after his legal difficulties began.\n\nAsked last year by Bloomberg why Mr. Trump rented to him when he was facing charges of running one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history, Mr. Hoffenberg said: \u201cHe\u2019s very objective. Renting space has nothing to do with color or race \u2014 or indictment. It has to do with if you can pay the rent.\u201d\n\nSince Mr. Trump\u2019s political career took off, there have been questions about his possible ties to Russia. In January 2017, he took to Twitter saying, \u201cI HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA \u2014 NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in 2002, the Bayrock Group, a real estate investment fund run by two Russian-born entrepreneurs, Tevfik Arif and Felix Sater, moved into office space on the 24th floor of Trump Tower, where they began work on the future Trump SoHo and used their connections to explore a possible Trump building in Moscow.\n\nIn 2006, Mr. Sater stayed with Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump in Moscow across from the Kremlin. The next year, The Times reported that Mr. Sater had been convicted of a felony assault and had pleaded guilty to running what authorities called a \u201cpump and dump\u201d scheme\u201d \u2014 buying large blocks of stocks in four companies, then flooding the market with false and misleading information about them.\n\nHe avoided jail time by becoming a government informant who, according to the former attorney general Loretta Lynch, provided crucial intelligence about a variety of international crime syndicates.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly tried to play down his involvement with Mr. Sater.\n\nIn 2007, he told The Times that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know [Mr. Sater] very well.\u201d In 2015, he told a reporter from The Associated Press that he was \u201cunfamiliar\u201d with him.\n\nIn 2017, Mr. Sater met with Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, at the Loews Regency on Park Avenue. There, Mr. Sater gave him a letter proposing the lifting of sanctions against Russia.\n\nThe letter, The Times later reported, was delivered to Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser at the time. The next week, Mr. Flynn was fired.\n\nOf late, Mr. Trump has also been distancing himself from another Trump Tower resident with ties to Russian interests. In addition to holding the deed to an apartment on the 43rd floor of Trump Tower since 2015, he was for several months last year the manager of his landlord\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nHis name: Paul Manafort.",

        "text": "Pakistani officials, in turn, have cited Indian influence as a primary cause of instability and insecurity in Afghanistan. Officials in Islamabad accuse India of supporting a hostile political regime in Kabul and funding militants, who use Afghanistan as a base to launch attacks inside Pakistan.\n\nEven before Mr. Trump unveiled his strategy on Monday, Islamabad was apprehensive and concerned.\n\nThe Pakistani military has been at the forefront of formulating the country\u2019s foreign policy and has taken the lead in defining the contours of Islamabad\u2019s relationship with Afghanistan and India. The civilian government has very little say, if any, in these policy initiatives.\n\nPakistani officials said they expected private contractors to take a more dominant role than troops already in Afghanistan. Senior Pakistani security officials stress that an all-inclusive engagement is the only option for peace inside Afghanistan. More troops inside the country, along with blaming Pakistan for harboring terrorists, will not work, they said in background interviews.\n\nHowever, there was no formal, official response to Mr. Trump\u2019s speech by Tuesday evening. Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, is to leave for the United States in the next few days to hold talks with American officials, a spokesman said.\n\nThe military also decided not to put forth a formal public response. In what could be viewed as a pre-emptive move, Major Gen Asif Ghafoor, the military spokesman, had said in a press briefing earlier on Monday that no terror group was operating inside Pakistan.\n\nSehar Kamran, an opposition senator who leads an Islamabad-based think tank, said Mr. Trump\u2019s plan appeared to be \u201cmore of the same, under much more colorful language and contradictory bluster.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shift from a timeline-oriented approach to a condition-based one, I think, is only the vocalization of a longstanding practice,\u201d she said, adding. \u201cWhat is concerning for Pakistan, however, is the contradiction within his statement that expresses both an acknowledgment of the country\u2019s sacrifices while simultaneously downplaying them by continuing accusations of \u2018sheltering terrorists,\u2019 and doing not enough with billions and billions paid by America.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I think Islamabad will remain rather firm in steering its engagement with both Kabul and Washington in that direction.\u201d\n\nOther analysts offered an even more scathing view of Mr. Trump\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cBy inviting India to be more active in Afghanistan, Trump has confirmed the worst fears of Pakistan\u2019s generals: that America is in cahoots with India against Pakistan,\u201d said Mosharraf Zaidi, a foreign-policy analyst in Islamabad.\n\n\u201cThere may never be a perfect approach to convince Pakistan to abandon the Haqqani network, but this speech was a terrible attempt,\u201d Mr. Zaidi said, referring to the Pakistan-based militant group that has been blamed for most of the deadly attacks inside Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, Maria Sultan, a defense analyst based in Islamabad and director general of the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute, said the Trump policy was \u201cnot as bad as we were expecting. The responsibility has been essentially shifted to Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nShe warned that intelligence-based operations against groups inside Pakistan might increase. \u201cThis will further reduce the space for cooperation between Pakistan and U.S. and will be counterproductive for a long-term relationship,\u201d Ms. Sultan said.",

        "text": "The appointees include lawyers who have represented businesses in cases against government regulators, staff members of political dark money groups, employees of industry-funded organizations opposed to environmental rules and at least three people who were registered to lobby the agencies they now work for.\n\nAt the Education Department alone, two members of the deregulation team were most recently employed by pro-charter advocacy groups or operators, and one appointee was an executive handling regulatory issues at a for-profit college operator.\n\nSo far, the process has been scattershot. Some agencies have been soliciting public feedback, while others refuse even to disclose who is in charge of the review. In many cases, responses to public records requests have been denied, delayed or severely redacted.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Interior Department has not disclosed the correspondence or calendars for its team. But a review of more than 1,300 pages of handwritten sign-in sheets for guests visiting the agency\u2019s headquarters in Washington found that appointees had met regularly with industry representatives.\n\nOver a four-month period, from February through May, at least 58 representatives of the oil and gas industry signed their names on the agency\u2019s visitor logs before meeting with appointees.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency also rejected requests to release the appointment calendar of the official leading its team \u2014 a former top executive for an industry-funded political group \u2014 even as she met privately with industry representatives.\n\nAnd the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security provided the titles for most appointees to their review teams, but not names.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen asked for comment about the activities of the deregulation teams, the White House referred reporters to the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nMeghan Burris, a spokeswoman there, said: \u201cAs previous administrations have recognized, it\u2019s good government to periodically reassess existing regulations. Past regulatory review efforts, however, have not taken a consistent enough look at regulations on the books.\u201d\n\nWith billions of dollars at stake in the push to deregulate, corporations and other industry groups are hiring lawyers, lobbyists and economists to help navigate this new avenue for influence. Getting to the front of the line is crucial, as it can take years to effect regulatory changes.\n\n\u201cCompetition will be fierce,\u201d the law firm Clark Hill, which represents businesses pitching the E.P.A., said in a marketing memo. \u201cIn all likelihood, interested parties will need to develop a multipronged strategy to expand support and win pre-eminence over competing regulatory rollback candidates.\u201d\n\nJane Luxton, a lawyer at the firm, said she advised clients to pay for economic and legal analyses that government agencies, short on staff, could use to expedite changes. She declined to identify the clients.\n\n\u201cYou may say this is an agency\u2019s job, but the agencies are totally overloaded,\u201d Ms. Luxton said.\n\nMeeting Behind Closed Doors\n\nOn a cloudy, humid day in March, Laura Peterson, a top lobbyist for Syngenta, arrived at the headquarters for the Interior Department. She looped the letter \u201cL\u201d across the agency\u2019s sign-in sheet.\n\nHer company, a top pesticide maker based in Switzerland, had spent eight years and millions of dollars lobbying the Obama administration on environmental rules, with limited success.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Ms. Peterson had an in with the new administration.\n\nScott Cameron, newly installed at the Interior Department and a member of its deregulation team, had just left a nonprofit he founded. He had advocated getting pesticides approved and out to market faster. His group counted Syngenta as a financial partner.\n\nThe meeting with Ms. Peterson was one of the first Mr. Cameron took as a new government official.\n\nNeither side would reveal what was discussed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s reporting information I have to give you,\u201d Ms. Peterson said.\n\nBut lobbying records offered clues.\n\nSyngenta has been one of several pesticide manufacturers pushing for changes to the Endangered Species Act. When federal agencies take actions that may jeopardize endangered animals or plants, they are generally supposed to consult with the Interior Department, which could raise objections.\n\nFor decades, the E.P.A. largely ignored this provision when approving new pesticides. But recently, a legal challenge from environmental groups forced its hand \u2014 a change that affected Syngenta.\n\nThis article was produced in collaboration with ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit investigative journalism organization.\n\nPesticide lobbyists have been working behind the scenes at agencies and on Capitol Hill to change the provision. Companies have argued that they should be exempt from consulting with the Interior Department because they already undergo E.P.A. approval.\n\nAlong with spending millions of dollars on lobbying, they have funded advocacy groups aligned with their cause. Mr. Cameron\u2019s nonprofit, the Reduce Risks From Invasive Species Coalition, was one such group for Syngenta.\n\nThe organization says on its website that its goals include reducing \u201cthe regulatory burden of the Endangered Species Act on American society by addressing invasive species.\u201d One way to do that is to use pesticides. The nonprofit\u2019s mission includes creating \u201cbusiness opportunities for commercial products and services used to control invasive species.\u201d\n\nBecause donations are not publicly reported, it is unclear how much Syngenta has contributed to Mr. Cameron\u2019s organization, but his group has called the pesticide company one of its \u201cgenerous sponsors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cameron also served on a committee of experts and stakeholders, including Syngenta, that advised the federal government on decisions related to invasive species. At a committee event last July, he said that one of his priorities was \u201cgetting biocontrol agents to market faster,\u201d according to meeting minutes.\n\nPaul Minehart, a Syngenta spokesman, said: \u201cEmployees regularly engage with those in government that relate to agriculture and our business. Our purpose is to balance serving the public health and environment with enabling farmers\u2019 access to innovation.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Interior Department did not respond to questions about how Mr. Cameron\u2019s relationship with Syngenta might influence his review of regulations.\n\nA Minefield of Conflicts\n\nUnder the law, members of the Trump administration can seek ethics waivers to work on issues that overlap with their past business careers. They can also formally recuse themselves when potential conflicts arise.\n\nIn many cases, the administration has refused to say whether appointees to Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulation teams have done either.\n\nOne such appointee is Samantha Dravis, the chairwoman of the deregulation team at the E.P.A., who was a top official at the Republican Attorneys General Association. Ms. Dravis was also president of the Rule of Law Defense Fund, which brought together energy companies and Republican attorneys general to file lawsuits against the federal government over Obama-era environmental regulations.\n\nThe Republican association\u2019s work has been criticized as a vehicle for corporate donors to gain the credibility and expertise of state attorneys general in fighting federal regulations. Donors include the American Petroleum Institute, the energy company ConocoPhillips and the coal giant Alpha Natural Resources.\n\nThe Republican association also received funding from Freedom Partners, backed by the conservative billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch. Ms. Dravis worked for that group as well, which recently identified regulations it wants eliminated. Among them are E.P.A. rules relating to clean-water protections and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLiz Bowman, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, declined to say whether Ms. Dravis had recused herself from issues dealing with previous employers or their backers, or had discussed regulations with any of them.\n\n\u201cAs you will find when you receive Samantha\u2019s calendar, she has met with a range of stakeholders, including nonprofits, industry groups and others, on a wide range of issues,\u201d Ms. Bowman said.\n\nMs. Bowman said the calendar could be obtained through a public records request. ProPublica and The Times had already filed a request for records including calendars, but the agency\u2019s response did not include those documents. (An appeal was filed, but the calendar has not yet been released.)\n\n\u201cWe take our ethics responsibilities seriously,\u201d Ms. Bowman said. \u201cAll political staff have had an ethics briefing and know their obligations.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAddressing the agency\u2019s regulatory efforts, she said, \u201cWe are here to enact a positive environmental agenda that provides real results to the American people, without unnecessarily hamstringing our economy.\u201d\n\nAt the Agriculture Department, the only known appointee to the deregulation team is Rebeckah Adcock. She previously lobbied the department as a top executive both at CropLife America, a trade association for pesticide makers, and the American Farm Bureau Federation, a trade group for farmers.\n\nThe department deals with many issues involving farmers, including crop insurance and land conservation rules, but it would not disclose whether Ms. Adcock had recused herself from discussions affecting her past employers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Both organizations fought against rooftop solar policies in statehouses across the country. Utility companies lose money when customers generate their own power, even more so when they are required to pay consumers who send surplus energy back into the grid.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough the Energy Department does not directly regulate electrical utilities, it does help oversee international electricity trade, the promotion of renewable energy and the security of domestic energy production. After joining the department, Mr. McCormack helped start a review of the nation\u2019s electrical grid, according to an agency memo.\n\nClean-energy advocates fear the inquiry will cast solar energy, which can fluctuate, as a threat to grid reliability. Such a finding could scare off state public utility commissions considering solar policies and serve as a boon for electrical utilities, said Matt Kasper, research director at the Energy and Policy Institute, an environmental group.\n\nDisclosure records show that while Mr. McCormack was at Edison, the trade group lobbied the federal government, including the Energy Department, on issues including grid reliability.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe department would not answer questions about Mr. McCormack\u2019s involvement with those issues.\n\nAcross the government, at least two appointees to deregulation teams have been granted waivers from ethics rules related to prior jobs, and at least nine others have pledged to recuse themselves from issues related to former employers or clients.\n\nSome of the recusals involve appointees at the Small Business Administration and the Education Department, including Bob Eitel, who leads the education team and was vice president for regulatory legal services at an operator of for-profit colleges.\n\nAnother recusal involves Byron Brown, an E.P.A. appointee who is married to a senior government affairs manager for the Hess Corporation, the oil and gas company.\n\nHess was fined and ordered to spend more than $45 million on pollution controls by the E.P.A. during the Obama administration because of alleged Clean Air Act violations at its refinery in Port Reading, N.J. Disclosure records show that Mr. Brown\u2019s wife, Lesley Schaaff, lobbied the E.P.A. last year on behalf of the company.\n\nAn E.P.A. spokeswoman declined to say whether Mr. Brown or Ms. Schaaff owned Hess stock, though an agency ethics official said Mr. Brown had recused himself from evaluating regulations affecting the company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe agency declined to say whether Mr. Brown would also recuse himself from issues affecting the American Petroleum Institute, where his wife\u2019s company is a member. The association has lobbied to ease Obama-era natural gas rules, complaining in a recent letter to Mr. Brown\u2019s team about an \u201cunprecedented level of federal regulatory actions targeting our industry.\u201d\n\nBefore being selected to lead the deregulation team at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Maren Kasper was a director at Roofstock, an online marketplace for investors in single-family rental properties. Financial disclosure records show that Ms. Kasper owned a stake in the company worth up to $50,000.\n\nChanges at HUD could increase investor interest in rental homes, affecting a company like Roofstock. The agency, for example, oversees the federal government\u2019s Section 8 subsidies program for low-income renters.\n\nPhoto\n\nEthics officials allowed Ms. Kasper to keep her stake, but she pledged not to take actions that would affect it. (A spokesman for HUD said Ms. Kasper\u2019s tenure on the deregulation task force had since ended.)\n\nThe Assault on Red Tape\n\nOne by one, scientists, educators and environmental activists approached the microphone and urged government officials not to weaken regulations intended to protect children from lead.\n\nThe forum, run by the E.P.A. in a drab basement meeting room in Washington, was part of the agency\u2019s push to identify regulations that were excessive and burdensome to businesses.\n\nFew businesspeople showed up. As public hearings on regulations have played out in recent weeks, many industry and corporate representatives have instead met with Trump administration officials behind closed doors.\n\nStill, the E.P.A. has asked for written comments and held about a dozen public meetings. The agency has received more than 467,000 comments, many of them critical of potential rollbacks, but also some from businesses large and small pleading for relief from regulatory costs or confusion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a quiet moment at the meeting to discuss lead regulations, the owner of a local painting company, Brian McCracken, moved to the microphone.\n\nMr. McCracken was frustrated by what he described as costly rules that forced him to test for lead-based paint in homes before he could begin painting. Each test kit costs about $2, and he may need six per room. If a family then declines to hire him, those costs come out of his pocket.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is sitting here saying that lead-based dust does not hurt children,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we are talking about. What the contractor needs is a better way to test.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHis voice quavered: \u201cWhy do I have to educate the general public about the hazards that generations before me created? It doesn\u2019t make sense at all.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is not the first president to take on such frustrations.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton declared that the federal government was failing to regulate \u201cwithout imposing unacceptable or unreasonable costs on society.\u201d He assigned Vice President Al Gore to collect agencies\u2019 suggestions for rules that should go. One rule dictated how to measure the consistency of grits.\n\nPresident George W. Bush\u2019s regulatory overhaul focused more on how new regulations were created. The administration installed a political appointee inside each agency who generally had to sign off before any significant new rule could be initiated. At the E.P.A. for a time, that official came from an industry-funded think tank.\n\nPresident Barack Obama ordered regular updates from each agency about the effectiveness of rules already on the books.\n\n\u201cWhen you raise the profile, when it\u2019s clearly an executive priority, it gets attention,\u201d said Heather Krause, director of strategic issues at the Government Accountability Office, the main auditor of the federal government. According to the auditor\u2019s analysis, the effect under Mr. Obama was mostly to clarify and streamline rules, not eliminate them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike Mr. Bush, Mr. Trump has empowered political appointees. Though some agencies have included career staff members on their review teams, an executive order from Mr. Trump creating the teams does not require it \u2014 nonpolitical employees are generally believed to be more wedded to existing rules. And like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump has imposed regular reporting requirements.\n\nBut Mr. Trump, who spent his business career on the other side of government regulations, has put an emphasis on cutting old rules.\n\nThe same day he signed the executive order initiating the review, he addressed a large crowd of conservative activists at a Maryland convention center.\n\n\u201cWe have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy \u2014 crushing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put the regulations industry out of work and out of business.\u201d\n\nAmit Narang, a regulatory expert at the liberal advocacy group Public Citizen, said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to create teams of political appointees \u2014 formally known as regulatory reform task forces \u2014 should make it easier for the White House to overcome bureaucratic resistance to his rollback plans.\n\n\u201cTo the extent there\u2019s a deep state effect in this administration,\u201d Mr. Narang said, \u201cthe task force will be more effective in trying to get the agenda in place.\u201d",

The resignation of these chief executives certainly sends a message. But as we have seen in the past, such gestures will have no effect on President Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\nOnly the Republican-controlled Congress is in a position to curb his worst impulses, and we will see no action until its members realize that they will pay a real price for nonaction. This is where corporate America can make a difference.\n\nIf chief executives across the political spectrum begin to heavily shift their campaign contributions from Republican to Democratic candidates for the House and the Senate in 2018 in the realization that the future of the United States is on the line, and with it their future profits, it will surely be noticed. And then we may see some real action from Congress.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo the question is: Are these C.E.O.s and their colleagues willing to go beyond mere gestures and exert the kind of influence that Congress understands by \u201cvoting\u201d with their money?

        "text": "Some have answered by withdrawing their support. The only black Republican in the Senate, Tim Scott of South Carolina, criticized Mr. Trump by telling Vice News that his \u201cmoral authority is compromised.\u201d\n\nSome black conservatives, prominent and not-so-prominent, are weighing whether to leave the party altogether because they fear that under Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership, Republicans may be complicit in espousing racism. Even after the ouster of Stephen K. Bannon, who as the president\u2019s chief strategist was accused of pushing white nationalist views into the West Wing, they say that Mr. Trump has to reckon with his response to the violence and his history of taking controversial racial stances.\n\nIf he wants absolution, they say, he needs to show contrition.\n\nMany black Republicans and their families have personally experienced racism \u2014 and in some cases witnessed violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan and other supremacist groups that lynched thousands of people, beat and murdered civil rights marchers, and supported segregationist policies that held African-Americans back.\n\nBlack conservatives balked at Mr. Trump\u2019s lament that it was \u201csad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments\u201d as an uncompromising defense of Confederate memorials.\n\nAnd they fretted that he and his administration have made \u201claw and order\u201d a centerpiece of their response to Charlottesville.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018tough on crime\u2019 phrase in my mind is nothing more than a code phrase for imprisoning blacks and people of color,\u201d Mr. Cheadle said, before criticizing Mr. Trump for hiring only a handful of black people in the West Wing. \u201cMr. Trump waxes eloquent about providing jobs as the panacea for the racial divide and curing the woes of the inner city. The president would do well to lead by example.\u201d\n\nThe majority of black Republicans interviewed said they would continue to support the president even as they criticize him. Most said they hope that Mr. Trump will prove his critics wrong and usher in a new phase of conservative policies that will overhaul the tax code, create new jobs, transform the health system and revamp the country\u2019s entitlement programs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeveral polls show that the majority of Republicans agreed with Mr. Trump\u2019s response, despite the intense backlash he received. And some African-Americans are in that camp.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that you can designate everybody who went to the rally from the camp of KKK as being nasty, mean, or say that their intention is to physically assault people,\u201d said Chuck Linton, 70, a retired military veteran from Baltimore and an African-American. \u201cI know that a lot of them, their intention is to be violent, but I don\u2019t think all of them are.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe white supremacists and the left wing, and the right wing and the middle wing are all the same anyway,\u201d he scoffed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Mr. Caldwell said he could not sleep the night of the raucous news conference when the president adamantly defended his \u201cblame on both sides\u201d position. He wept the next day on Fox News.\n\n\u201cI knew after the news conference that he was going to want to see some positive coverage, probably some black folks in front of the screen saying really nice things about how he is awesome and he rocked that news conference,\u201d Mr. Caldwell said of Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be used as a puppet.\u201d\n\nMr. Caldwell added that it was \u201chard to defend President Trump when you know that no matter what happens in some days or weeks, he is going to step on the message and say something ridiculous and change the conversation.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, he said, \u201cIf there is a position that I can agree with him on, I will, but it is going to be with a much more critical viewpoint then there was before.\u201d\n\nHis position echoed Mr. Scott, who followed his Vice interview by saying on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that the president could \u201cregain\u201d his moral authority by sitting down with \u201cfolks who have a personal experience, a deep connection to the horror and the pain of this country\u2019s provocative racial history.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nQuardricos Driskell, a Republican federal lobbyist and a religion and politics professor at George Washington University, never supported the president and said he believed early in the campaign that Mr. Trump held discriminatory views.\n\n\u201cThe moral dilemma I face at this very moment and the question I have to wrestle with is Trump being the head of the Republican Party and yet courting and being complicit with this very small group that has always been at the fringes of our society,\u201d said Mr. Driskell, who remains a Republican. \u201cHe has now helped to usher them into the mainstream. What does that mean as a black man who happens to be a Republican and happens to believe in conservative values and principles?\u201d\n\nLiberal activists say black Republicans have been ignoring Mr. Trump\u2019s long history of racially offensive behavior. Mr. Trump settled a Justice Department suit that charged the family business with housing discrimination and falsely accused the nation\u2019s first black president of being born in Kenya.\n\n\u201cWe are in the predicament that we are in now because of the fact that people did not read the writing on the wall,\u201d said Tamika D.

        "text": "You know that American politics has jumped the rails when a U.S. contractor is relieved to get back from America to his little base in Afghanistan.\n\nAnyway, enough of that. Since I can\u2019t explain Trump\u2019s Middle East, let me explain what I saw here \u2014 three things in particular: I saw a new way of mounting warfare by the United States in Iraq. I saw in this new warfare a strategy that offers at least a glimmer of hope for Iraq, if and when ISIS is defeated. But, though only a glimpse, I saw in Afghanistan an eroding stalemate \u2014 with all the same issues that have undermined stability there for years: government corruption, distrust among Afghans and perfidious interventions by Pakistan and Iran.\n\nThe best way for me to explain what\u2019s new in Iraq is with a scene I watched unfold on Saturday. We were at the joint strike cell in Erbil, in Iraqi Kurdistan. This is where multiple Air Force television feeds come in live from drones, U-2s, satellites and U.S. and coalition fighter jets. The officers there are coordinating with Iraqi Army combat forces on the ground and their U.S. military advisers embedded just behind the battlefront to hit ISIS targets as the Iraqi Army begins its push west.\n\nHaving retaken Mosul, the Iraqi Army is driving ISIS into the Euphrates River Valley, where it looks like it will make a last stand. This was the second day of the Iraqis\u2019 thrust west and they were already meeting resistance in a small town on the road to ISIS-controlled Tal Afar. Several U.S. eyes in the sky were trained on a single-story, flat-roof building, about 30 feet wide, sandwiched between two larger buildings. Iraqi soldiers crawling toward this building were receiving lots of small-arms fire from inside, stalling their advance about 500 feet away.\n\nTheir U.S. advisers were sending all this information to the strike cell in real time. Meanwhile in the strike cell, team members sitting in front of computer screens were calculating exactly how much firepower was required to kill the ISIS fighters and not hurt any civilians who might be nearby. They did a quick tally of the remaining weapons on the American fighter aircraft in the area \u2014 seeing which had what smart bombs left.\n\nSeconds later a call of \u201cweapon away, 30 seconds\u201d rang out as an F-15E released a 500-pound GPS-guided smart bomb. The screen rebroadcasting the F-15E\u2019s targeting pod showed the bomb going straight down through the roof.\n\n\u201cWe have splash,\u201d said one of the controllers in a monotone as a huge plume of smoke engulfed the video screen. Quickly, the smoke cleared and the 30-foot-wide building was smoldering rubble \u2014 but the two buildings to the sides were totally intact, so any civilians inside should be unhurt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe officer in charge told me that a few weeks earlier, during the campaign to retake Mosul, two Iraqi soldiers were wounded and hiding from an ISIS unit inside a building 15 yards away. Using laser targeting, the U.S. team fired a rocket whose size, direction and shape were chosen to take down only the ISIS building and make its walls fall in the opposite direction of the two pinned-down Iraqis. The rocket worked as intended and they were rescued.\n\nThis is war in Iraq today in a nutshell.\n\nFor years we\u2019ve measured our involvement in Middle East wars by one pair of indexes \u2014 boots on the ground and killed in action. Because of that, most Americans are now paying scant attention to Iraq, where our boots on the ground have shrunk to a few thousand and where there have been just 17 U.S. military deaths since we re-engaged in Iraq to defeat ISIS in 2014.\n\nBut the real story is wings in the air. We are involved in a gigantic military enterprise in Iraq. But it\u2019s with massive conventional air power married to unconventional special forces, who are advising the Iraqi Army that is actually doing the ground fighting. This is making our presence in Iraq much more sustainable for us and for the Iraqis.\n\nIronically, it might never have happened had President Barack Obama not withdrawn our combat troops from Iraq in 2011 because Iraqis couldn\u2019t agree on a legal formula for their staying.\n\nAfter that, the then-Shiite-led Iraqi government began abusing Sunnis, and ISIS emerged in response. That forced Iraqis to rethink their relationship with us. A U.S. Air Force special operations officer told me of returning to Iraq in early 2014 and meeting with the Iraqi Counterterrorism Service \u2014 the only truly professional, nonsectarian fighting unit then left in the country. The U.S. officer had come to ask the CTS what material aid the U.S. could offer in the fight against ISIS, and the CTS commander responded that he didn\u2019t need aid. \u201cWe want you,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

When George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 to topple Saddam Hussein, we destroyed the government from the top down. We toppled Saddam\u2019s statue. And we were advised largely by Iraqi exiles of dubious legitimacy in local eyes.\n\nIt became our war, producing iconic pictures of U.S. soldiers kicking down doors and pointing guns at cowering women.\n\nEven though ISIS emerged after we left, we have now returned at the invitation of Iraqis from the bottom up, not exiles \u2014 making our presence much more legitimate and sustainable for any long fight. Iraqi Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds were forced to unify, at least minimally, to defeat ISIS, opening new possibilities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is Iraq\u2019s war of liberation. They own it.\n\nI met Marine Col. Seth Folsom, who commands a forward special operations air base, Al-Asad, in the western Iraqi desert. It was 120 degrees outside, but he had a bounce in his step.\n\n\u201cI was here in 2003 and in 2008,\u201d he told me. In those days, if he had a convoy going through a town it would speed 100 miles an hour not to get shot at or blown up, pushing Iraqi cars out of the way, creating resentments. \u201cNow we are driving with the Iraqis. It\u2019s a paradigm shift. It doesn\u2019t even seem like the same country to me. Now I am saying to my Iraqi counterparts, \u2018What do you want to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo we are fighting a very different war in Iraq, which Trump has amped up. But you can\u2019t grasp its true dimensions unless you go to the overall U.S. regional air headquarters in Qatar and watch on giant screens a 24/7 choreography that boggles the mind: B-52s, U-2s, F-16s, F-22s, F-35s, F-15s, A-10s, C-17s, V-22s, U-28s, C-130s, JStars, AWACs, satellites and unmanned Reapers and Predators \u2014 all fueled aloft by a fleet of KC-10 and KC-135 flying gas stations \u2014 that have conducted 23,934 strikes on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria, using 84,585 precision-guided bombs, since we came back in 2014.\n\nThere is much still to worry about. At the joint operations headquarters in Baghdad, U.S. officers plan on computer screens and the Iraqi planners on wall-size maps with markers and blue arrows representing troops that they move around. It can drive American planners crazy when speed is of the essence.\n\nMore worrying: American advisers at the joint operations headquarters told me that many of their Iraqi counterparts take their uniforms off before they go home at night. Not everyone respects them for working with the Americans, particularly in the hard-line Shiite areas. Some have even had to change houses.\n\nAnd yet, they still show up, and their men still fought house-to-house to recapture Mosul, taking huge casualties. At the height of the battle for Mosul, the U.S. Air Force field hospital at Al-Asad Air Base treated many Iraqi soldiers. The U.S. officer who heads the hospital told us that when the first Iraqi wounded soldier arrived, and he desperately needed blood, the U.S. commander asked for six volunteers. Some 50 American military personnel showed up to donate.\n\n\u201cIt is one thing for us to be respectful of the Iraqis and another to respect the Iraqis,\u201d the Air Force chief of staff, Gen. Dave Goldfein, remarked to me. \u201cToday there is mutual respect. We admire their tenacity.\u201d\n\nAll of that said, I am still wary. There is no slam-dunk here. While ISIS is on the run, lasting victory in Iraq depends entirely on whether Iraqis can come together \u2014 not just to fight a shared enemy but to build a shared government \u2014 the morning after ISIS is defeated.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlas, there is no \u201cpower-sharing\u201d bomb that we can drop on the Iraqi Parliament that will make Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds trust one another enough to live together as equal citizens. And there is no \u201cculture-buster\u201d bomb that we can drop that will burrow deep into Iraqi/Arab culture and stop them from always letting their past bury their future and instead start letting their future bury their past.\n\nCulture always trumps strategy and only they can change their political culture. As the overall U.S. commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, put it to me: After ISIS is defeated, Iraqis need to produce a government \u201cfor all Iraqis.\u201d It cannot be a government where \u201cSunnis feel disenfranchised.\u201d We better have in place a strategy for coaching Iraqis on power-sharing as much as we did on dynamic targeting. Otherwise, the morning after ISIS 1.0 is defeated we\u2019ll see ISIS 2.0.\n\nThe war in Afghanistan is different. The air power component is there but U.S. Special Forces are still doing too much fighting and dying. And Trump talked on Monday night like they will now do more. And we don\u2019t have the legitimacy you now feel in Iraq.\n\nPersonal security for our Afghan allies is still minimal. I stood on the tarmac at Bagram Airfield and listened as a U.S.-trained Afghan pilot explained that the last thing he does before climbing into the cockpit is call home to be sure his kids have not been abducted by the Taliban, who know that he works with the U.S. and have threatened him repeatedly.\n\nAgain, the fact that this pilot is still ready to fly with the U.S. shows real courage. He wants something different for his country, and he\u2019s not alone. But is he in the majority? Clearly he\u2019s got neighbors who don\u2019t think that we, or the Afghan government we\u2019re supporting, are legitimate. Culture trumps strategy.\n\nThis is going to take ages to fix, and if you fix Afghanistan, well, you fix Afghanistan. So what. If you fix Iraq with a real power-sharing accord you create a model that can radiate out across the Arab world, because Iraq is a microcosm of the Arab world, with Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds, Turkmen, Christians and many others.\n\nI slept well in the U.S. Embassy green zone in Baghdad, which is protected outside by Iraqis. Two nights earlier we slept at the Bagram base near Kabul and were repeatedly awakened by a blaring loudspeaker saying \u201ctake cover,\u201d because another rocket was coming in.\n\nFor the moment \u2014 and I stress moment \u2014 we have a sustainable military strategy to defeat ISIS in Iraq. But a sustainable political outcome depends on Iraqis rising to the occasion. I do not see that in Afghanistan and I did not hear it in Trump\u2019s speech. I fear our choices there are unchanged: lose early, lose late, lose big or lose small.",

        "text": "The photographs from Charlottesville, Va., last weekend tell multiple stories. They document a rally, \u201cUnite the Right,\u201d where a protest over the removal of a Confederate monument served as a smokescreen for spewing racist and anti-Semitic hate. They show the counterprotesters who gathered to uphold the values of democracy and justice. They depict the murder and injury of some of these courageous individuals.\n\nSome of the most fascinating and telling photographs focus on groups of enraged men carrying Tiki torches and shouting racist and anti-Semitic slogans as they marched through the streets of Charlottesville. Perhaps the most significant implication of these images is the extent to which neo-Nazism and white supremacy have entered a new era \u2014 a movement mainstreamed by its followers and enabled by a sitting president.\n\nThese photographs and startling video footage portrayed neo-Nazis and white supremacists not as abstract figures lurking in shadows or concealed by hoods but as proud men and women openly displaying their bigotry. Their visibility also made them identifiable, so much so that a Twitter account, \u201cYes, You\u2019re Racist,\u201d circulated photos of them in an effort to publicly expose and shame them.\n\nThe photographic documentation of hate has typically stressed the consequences of bigotry, violence and genocide to demonstrate its gravity: the shattered, glass-strewn German streets, Jewish businesses and synagogues that were photographed as the sun rose on the devastation of Kristallnacht in November 1938; stark pictures of young people clinging to a building as Bull Connor\u2019s troops targeted them with forceful water jets during the Children\u2019s Crusade in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963; a dying Philando Castile, his bloodied and lifeless body live-streamed last summer by his girlfriend, after he was shot by the police during a traffic stop near St. Paul.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut some of the most consequential photographs of racial discord, like the images out of Charlottesville, focus not on the victim but on the perpetrator. They reveal what pictures of oppression, violence and destruction generally do not: the ordinary people who typically perpetuate white supremacy. These people are sons and daughters, siblings, spouses and parents who today have traded Klan hoods for polo shirts and khakis. Many are college educated and employed in white collar jobs. They look like people we know \u2014 friends, co-workers, neighbors and family. And they have one thing in common: an allegiance to a scurrilous ideology bent on intimidating, disempowering, and even annihilating African-Americans, Jews and others they view as foreign or racially impure.\n\nA former F.B.I. agent, Michael German, who went undercover with neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups, observed on CNN that the most perilous threat comes from activists who blend into mainstream society. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily the skinhead with the tattoos and the club who was dangerous,\u201d Mr. German said, \u201cbut somebody who wore a suit and went to work in an office and was college educated and much more capable as a threat than some drunk skinhead.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe mainstreaming of hate is not new. Cameras have revealed the ordinariness of racist and anti-Semitic agitators: the fresh-faced zealots of the Hitler Youth; the family-minded Nazi sympathizers of the German-American Bund; the well-dressed lynch mobs, posing before black and Mexican bodies dangling from trees; or the unrequited rage of a white teenager, her face contorted in fury, as she screams at an African-American student integrating a high school in Little Rock, Ark.\n\nBut now President Trump\u2019s seeming inability to forcefully condemn as terrorism the actions of domestic hate groups enables them in ways that are unprecedented. To ignore, dismiss, or manipulate the implications of these photographs is to further the injustices they represent. As Donald J. Trump draws moral equivalence between the forces of racist and anti-Semitic hate and the men and women who stood up to them, he reveals a distorted sense of right and wrong.\n\nWe cannot ignore the logic of President Trump\u2019s words, which would equate the rebellious inmates of the Warsaw Ghetto with the Nazi collaborators who imprisoned and murdered them or condemn the brave young people of the Children\u2019s Crusade as they rose up against the noxious belief system of Jim Crow segregation. Can we credibly argue that these courageous people were morally equivalent to their oppressors?\n\nPhoto\n\nThe photographs of white supremacist rage and resentment in Charlottesville do more than affirm that unrepentant bigots live next door to us, date our sons and daughters, and work in our institutions. They also remind us that blindly supporting a president committed to stoking the flames of white supremacy and bigotry is itself an act of complicity.\n\nA vast majority of Americans are good people who are clearly repulsed by what that they have witnessed in the photographs of Charlottesville. But the very ordinariness of the people these images bluntly represent underscores that bigotry is not solely perpetrated at the extremes and as something exceptional. It is everywhere, having infiltrated every corner of society and culture, in places and institutions on the right, left, and in the middle.\n\nMaurice Berger is a research professor and the chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

        "text": "Mr. Trump borrowed conservatives\u2019 lingo on Tuesday, saying the \u201calt-left\u201d bore responsibility, using a phrase popular with commentators like Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity.\n\n\u201cThey think there were 300 or so racists who showed up to a rally, and who got exactly what they wanted: Violence, and violence in a way that inspires the nation\u2019s elite to double down on iconoclasm in a way they hope grows their movement,\u201d said Ben Domenech, the publisher of The Federalist, an online magazine.\n\nA headline on The Federalist on Monday summed up that sentiment: \u201cWhite Supremacists Were Not the Only Thugs Tearing Up Charlottesville.\u201d\n\nA site called The Patriot Post created a meme called \u201cThey Lie\u201d using two juxtaposed photographs. The first was a man looking at Mr. Trump waving to a sea of cheering fans; the second was a picture of that same man wearing glasses covered in the CNN logo, but seeing instead a group of Hitler Youth saluting their leader.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTownhall.com offered another provocative take: \u201cHow the Liberal Media Created Charlottesville.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and conservatives have pointed to several recent episodes as evidence of the left gone mad. They include the comedian Kathy Griffin\u2019s posing for a picture with a fake severed Trump head, and a production of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d that featured a Trump-like actor as the emperor who is fatally stabbed onstage.\n\nSome seized on the shooting that seriously injured Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, at a congressional baseball team practice in June as further proof. One recent web video from the National Rifle Association accused liberals of attempting to \u201cbully and terrorize the law abiding\u201d as it implored Americans to \u201cfight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.\u201d\n\nBut the tragedy in Charlottesville \u2014 specifically, the death of a young woman at the hands of a Nazi sympathizer who the authorities said ran her down with his car \u2014 undercut the notion that the black-masked radical leftists who smash windows and hurl firebombs are an equal menace.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNor is it backed up by data on political violence. Of at least 372 murders that were committed by domestic extremists between 2007 and 2016, according to a study by the Anti-Defamation League, 74 percent were committed by right-wing extremists. Muslim extremists were responsible for 24 percent of those killings, and the small remainder were committed by left-wing extremists, the study concluded.\n\nNoah Rothman, an editor for Commentary Magazine, a conservative opinion journal, said the emphasis for many conservatives is not on statistics that indicate who is the more violent offender. Rather, he said, the point is about the general tenor of political debate, which people like him believe is weighted against them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a ton of reporters banging on the doors of Democrats asking them to denounce Antifa,\u201d he said, referring to the militant Marxist-inspired group that rioted at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and often shows up looking for confrontation at sites where conservative writers like Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos are scheduled to speak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re comparing a body count, and that to me seems like it\u2019s the wrong place to start,\u201d Mr. Rothman added. \u201cThe place to start is when we have violence in the streets. We need to have a conversation about where we are as a country.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is no mere bit player in the discussion of political violence. At various times, he has offered to pay the legal bills of supporters who get in brawls at his events and stated, without offering any proof, that paid agitators were responsible for protests against him.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s sympathizers generally amplify these claims, including some who did after Charlottesville. Alex Jones, the right-wing provocateur and Sandy Hook massacre denier whom Mr. Trump once personally called to thank for his support, said people who protested the white supremacists over the weekend were probably actors.\n\nIn an internet broadcast on Saturday, Mr. Jones played down the significance of the violence, saying it was likely staged by \u201cDemocratic Party activists\u201d who are looking to \u201coverdemonize\u201d whites and \u201cput chips on the shoulders of the so-called minorities.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cDemographically, blacks are 12 times more likely to attack whites for no reason,\u201d Mr. Jones went on, providing no evidence for his claim. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe then recounted his own experience watching a Nazi rally he said was attended by Jews posing as Nazis, evident by their \u201ccurly hair, and you know, dark eyes.\u201d\n\nMike Cernovich, a conspiracy theory peddler, was gleeful as he posted on Twitter about the violence on Saturday. \u201cCivil War is here!\u201d he wrote.\n\nLike others on the far right, he said the rhetoric on the left was to blame: \u201cThe left has preached hatred for decades. Those they hated began to hate them back. How is anyone surprised by this?\u201d\n\nMr. Cernovich headlined a \u201cRally for Peace\u201d in Washington after the Scalise shooting, a rally that quickly turned into a referendum on the left\u2019s culpability in the crime. He also played a central role in the \u201cPizzagate\u201d hoax that attempted to link Hillary Clinton to a child sex ring and has been praised by Mr. Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. as being worthy of a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nThere is also a new political term to describe the circular firing squad in which right and left have blamed the other for the country\u2019s degenerating political debate \u2014 \u201cwhataboutism.\u201d\n\nGuy Benson, a conservative writer and an author of the book \u201cEnd of Discussion,\u201d which argues that the left has tried to shut down political debate by declaring certain topics off the table, said he sees a \u201cwhataboutism overreach\u201d among some conservatives.\n\nBut on the other hand, he said, \u201cAre we allowed to point out that left-wing violence is a problem and did probably contribute to what happened in Charlottesville and not be compared to Hitler?\u201d\n\nHe said that conservatives would be better served by finding other ways to make points of media bias and political double standards.\n\n\u201cRound and round we go with this one-upsmanship of who\u2019s worse,\u201d Mr. Benson added, \u201cand that\u2019s a really terrible way to argue.\u201d",

        "text": "Of that, just 8 percentage points will result from medical inflation, and 2 percentage points will stem from the reinstatement of an Obamacare health insurance tax; the balance will be related to the uncertainty that Mr. Trump has created around key pieces of Obamacare.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe largest portion of the total \u2014 about 15 percentage points \u2014 is connected to the potential demise of the cost-sharing reductions (known as C.S.R.s), payments made by the government to insurers to help cover out-of-pocket costs like co-pays and deductibles that lower-income Americans can\u2019t afford.\n\n(The Congressional Budget Office said on Tuesday that premiums for the most popular health insurance plans would rise by 20 percent next year, and federal budget deficits would increase by $194 billion in the coming decade, if Mr. Trump ends the subsidies.)\n\nThose subsidies, which were created by the Obama health care legislation and which benefit seven million Americans, have been in limbo since House Republicans sued in 2014, contending that they needed to be appropriated by Congress, which wasn\u2019t going to happen as long as Republicans controlled each chamber.\n\nHow Cost-Sharing Subsidies Reduce Deductibles \u2026 Figures for silver plans. Income less than 150% of FPL Between 150-200% of FPL Between 200\u2013250% of FPL No subsidies $255 809 2,904 3,609 Income less than 150% of FPL Between 150-200% of FPL Between 200\u2013250% of FPL No subsidies $255 809 2,904 3,609 Average deductibles with subsidies, by income level.\n\n\u2026 And Out-of-Pocket Costs Income less than 150% of FPL Between 150-200% of FPL Between 200\u2013250% of FPL No subsidies $941 1,875 5,233 6,528 Income less than 150% of FPL Between 150-200% of FPL Between 200\u2013250% of FPL No subsidies $941 1,875 5,233 6,528\n\nConservatives won the first round in court, but that decision was stayed pending appeal, allowing both the Obama and Trump administrations to continue to make the monthly payments.\n\nPresident Trump has threatened to end the subsidies but has yet to take definitive action. A decision was promised by Aug. 4, but Mr. Trump decamped to his New Jersey golf resort with nary a word about C.S.R.s.\n\nAs a result, many of the insurance companies that have already announced their increases have either baked in increases assuming loss of the subsidies or say that they will impose further hikes if the subsidies are not continued.\n\nThe silence around the C.S.R.s is consistent with the new administration\u2019s overall approach to the A.C.A.: continually badmouthing it and taking small steps to undermine it without unleashing a full-force assault.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Cuts to cost-sharing subsidies Medical inflation Non-enforcement of mandate Federal health insurance tax Total average premium increase 15% 8 4 2 29 Cuts to cost-sharing subsidies Medical inflation Non-enforcement of mandate Federal health insurance tax Total average premium increase 15% 8 4 2 29\n\nAt the same time, some steps toward preparing for the next enrollment period are proceeding normally, such as an annual meeting in June with \u201cnavigators\u201d who guide consumers in their choices of plans.\n\nIn addition, the Trump team has been allocating funds to states with weak exchange markets to encourage insurers to continue to provide coverage.\n\nBut what else the administration will or won\u2019t do as the November opening of the enrollment period approaches remains a mystery.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAsked last week by The Washington Post to clarify, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would say only, \u201cAs open enrollment approaches, we are evaluating how to best serve the American people who access coverage on HealthCare.gov.\u201d\n\nAn hour later, the spokeswoman, Jane Norris, tried to withdraw the statement and refused to comment further. Ms. Norris\u2019s office did not respond at all to my inquiry.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators is trying to draft legislation to stabilize Obamacare. But with Congress gone, any new laws will come too late for the Sept. 5 deadline for setting 2018 premiums.\n\nSo it well may be up to Mr. Trump to decide, in effect, the fate of the exchanges, which supply about 12 million Americans with their coverage. With final premium increase decisions due soon, even inaction could be devastating.\n\nAs the president has acknowledged on occasion and as public opinion polls confirm, the failure of Congress to pass any legislation means that the new administration \u201cowns\u201d the health care issue politically. Continuing to let it flounder in the twilight zone will be damaging not only to Mr. Trump\u2019s political health but more important, to the health of millions of Americans who deserve better.",

        "text": "Photo\n\nThe white nationalist demonstrations that led to violence in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend focused attention not just on the far-right groups that organized the rally but also on the professed anti-fascist groups and individuals who staged counterprotests. Both sides are considering what actions to take in the future.\n\nWho marched against the \u2018Unite the Right\u2019 rally?\n\nThose who marched against the rally on Saturday in Charlottesville said they stood broadly in solidarity against white supremacy, but they espoused a wide array of ideological beliefs, preferred tactics and political goals. A large number were ordinary residents of Charlottesville who wanted to show their disdain for white supremacist groups, particularly after the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the city on July 8. But some carried signs expressing more far-flung ideologies \u2014 denouncing capitalism, for instance, alongside fascism and racism.\n\nWho organized the counterprotest?\n\nA Charlottesville-based network of activists and clergy members called Solidarity Cville called attention to the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally and urged people to show their opposition. The group includes ministers from local churches, as well as racial justice activists.\n\nPhoto\n\nDid they expect violence?\n\nYes. Brittany Caine-Conley, a minister at Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville who is part of Solidarity Cville, sent a warning message in advance of the rally. \u201cThere is an extremely high potential for physical violence and brutality directed at our community,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe need your help \u2014 we don\u2019t have the numbers to stand up to this on our own.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOrganizers of the counterprotest said it was important to turn out even with the threat of violence.\n\n\u201cWe cannot ignore them away as their numbers grow and their influence expands,\u201d Matthew Owens of Showing Up for Racial Justice, a local group that is part of Solidarity Cville, said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot let their worldview normalize.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWere all of the counterprotesters nonviolent?\n\nNo. A complete picture of the violence that took place in Charlottesville is still unfolding, as those who were arrested face an array of charges and more photographs and videos emerge from the chaotic scenes. After a car barreled into a crowd of counterprotesters and killed a 32-year-old woman, the organizer of the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally, Jason Kessler, was heckled, punched and forced to flee a news conference by an angry crowd.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

The account owner, Jack Posobiec, is known for promoting false narratives such as the \u201cPizzagate\u201d hoax and a conspiracy theory about the murder of a Democratic aide.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tweet on Chicago violence was in keeping with comments he made throughout the campaign, and with what some of his allies said after Charlottesville, accusing the news media of giving undue attention to the neo-Nazis who went to the town instead of the counterprotesters.\n\nMr. Trump has also frequently reached for Chicago\u2019s violence as a negative example when explaining himself, including in a recent speech on Long Island, where he described the city\u2019s high crime rate and argued that it was easier to fix than the city\u2019s local leaders acknowledged.",

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nContrast that with another member of the board, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr., who not only is staying on but has also lauded President Trump\u2019s \u201cbold, truthful statement\u201d on Charlottesville.\n\nTo be fair, some of the evangelical advisory board members have spoken out against the white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville. Johnnie Moore, a public-relations executive who works with evangelical groups and is a member of the board, was even willing to criticize Mr. Trump, saying, \u201cThe president is certainly guilty of being insensitive.\u201d But for the most part, members of this board have made it clear that they approve of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, and his performance in office generally, and that they intend to remain a bulwark of support for him.\n\nIt is important to understand that these leaders, despite their megachurches and presidential access, do not speak for all Christians in this country. My organization, the National Council of Churches, is made up of 30 million Christians in more than 100,000 local congregations of its member denominations \u2014 Orthodox, Anglican, mainline Protestant and historic peace churches \u2014 who have been quick to rally against the rise of white supremacists and neo-Nazis.\n\nSince at least the early 1960s, when one of my predecessors, J. Irwin Miller, put the National Council of Churches at the center of the civil rights movement, our member churches have been committed to justice and tolerance, and have used their position in their communities to rally support against racism and oppression.\n\nA few members of the evangelical board have argued that whatever the president\u2019s mistakes, it is better for them to remain in a position to influence him. But they overestimate their ability to shape the president\u2019s thinking and underappreciate the impact that taking a stand against his comments would have.\n\nBut again, most of them have remained silent. And that silence speaks volumes. They do not appear to fear that their association with a president who defends the statues of those who fought for slavery, as well as white supremacists and neo-Nazis, will create problems for them with their congregations, universities, seminaries, television audiences or nonprofit organizations. This may be a miscalculation: Already, dozens of Liberty University alumni are returning their diplomas, disgusted with Mr. Falwell\u2019s stalwart support of the president.\n\nIn the coming months and years, America\u2019s Christians will be repeatedly tested \u2014 by their president, and by a society increasingly riven along racial and religious lines. Charlottesville is just the beginning. I am proud that during the rally and counter-protests that weekend, the denominations that constitute the National Council of Churches were present in a dignified, disciplined, nonviolent manner, and they refused to cower before the white nationalists who were shouting abuse, wielding clubs and inciting violence that caused the death of an innocent bystander.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe refuse to countenance a president who gives quarter to those who sow hate and injustice among the American public. Our congregations will continue to witness to a God who loves everyone regardless of race or creed. We need our evangelical sisters and brothers to join us.",

Chinese spies have gone after private defense contractors and subcontractors, national laboratories, public research universities, think tanks and the American government itself. Chinese agents have gone after the United States\u2019 most significant weapons, such as the F-35 Lightning, the Aegis Combat System and the Patriot missile system; illegally exported unmanned underwater vehicles and thermal-imaging cameras; and stolen documents related to the B-52 bomber, the Delta IV rocket, the F-15 fighter and even the Space Shuttle.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s action on Monday acknowledges the broad scope of the challenge. Central to Chinese cybersecurity law is the \u201csecure and controllable\u201d standard, which, in the name of protecting software and data, forces companies operating in China to disclose critical intellectual property to the government and requires that they store data locally. Even before this Chinese legislation, some three-quarters of Chinese imported software was pirated. Now, despite the law, American companies may be even more vulnerable.\n\nFor decades, successive American administrations have concluded that some level of exposure to China\u2019s depredations against our intellectual property is simply the cost of doing business with the world\u2019s now second-largest economy. This is not acceptable. Although China is an important trading partner with the United States, it is imperative to establish a fair and level trading environment.\n\nDriving down intellectual-property theft by China and other countries is vital for America\u2019s economic well-being and national security. We urge American companies, as well as our allies abroad, who share these interests, to work with the administration through this process.\n\nThere is intellectual-property protection on the books in China, and some American companies have been successful bringing cases in Chinese courts. The time may come when China applies the same efforts to protecting intellectual property that it now does to stealing it. However, for now, the United States and other developed countries must look to their own laws and actions to protect their companies from loss and ruin.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s action on Monday is a major step in the right direction. If the investigation proves extensive Chinese government support for intellectual-property theft, it could trigger retaliatory action by the American government, based on the Economic Espionage Act, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nThe government should lead in this effort, but it can\u2019t go it alone. A broad, sustained campaign bringing together the government, the private sector and our allies is the only way to halt this hemorrhaging of America\u2019s economic life blood.",

        "text": "Zhang Ping, a scholar of trade law at Peking University in Beijing, said the West had long used intellectual property laws as a \u201cspear and shield\u201d against Chinese companies, hurting their profits at home and blocking access to foreign markets. Now, she said, it is time for China to fight back.\n\n\u201cIf you want to enter our market to cooperate, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Ms. Zhang said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t grab us by the neck and not let us grow.\u201d\n\nTrademarks and patents protect companies and inventors, compensating them for their time, ideas and investment. While poorer countries have throughout history worked to obtain inventions from wealthier nations, sometimes running afoul of intellectual property laws, China has rewritten the playbook for acquiring advanced technology.\n\nSince Deng Xiaoping, as leader, opened the Chinese economy to the outside world nearly four decades ago, the country has made it a priority to obtain ideas and inspiration from overseas.\n\nSometimes it has reverse-engineered what it wants. United States officials say that Chinese companies have also carried out extensive economic espionage through cyberattacks and other means. (Chinese officials have denied those charges.) More recently, China has used its growing wealth to buy into cutting-edge technologies, like genetically modified crops and the latest innovations from American start-ups, and to attract promising talent.\n\nBut since those early days, China has relied heavily on one tried-and-true method: forming joint ventures with foreign partners. Big-name companies like I.B.M. and Qualcomm are required to share advanced technology and research with domestic firms in order to set up shop in China. And to entice partners, the country offers access to its enormous market and hundreds of millions of consumers.\n\nPhoto\n\nJoint ventures helped China build whole industries from scratch. After using them to explore high-speed rail technology, Chinese firms now dominate the global industry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChinese experts say those moves are simply smart deal-making, not violations of intellectual property laws, allowing the country to harness its leverage as the world\u2019s second largest economy to win practical knowledge.\n\nBut now China\u2019s efforts are moving beyond routine manufacturing into cutting-edge technologies \u2014 and the Trump administration has denounced the arrangements as coercive.\n\nIn April, the Office of the United States Trade Representative accused China of \u201cwidespread infringing activity,\u201d including stealing trade secrets, tolerating rampant online piracy and exporting counterfeit goods. On Monday, President Trump signed a memo that authorized an investigation into theft and the forced transfer of technology by China from American firms. But he mentioned China by name only once.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday that it would defend China\u2019s interests if they appeared to be threatened by the investigation.\n\n\u201cChina will absolutely not sit by and watch, will inevitably adopt all appropriate measures, and resolutely safeguard China\u2019s lawful rights,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\nChinese commentators see hypocrisy in American criticism, noting that the United States was once one of the world\u2019s leading pirates, when it worked to challenge British industrial dominance after the American Revolution by obtaining designs for inventions like steam-powered looms. The state-run news media has highlighted the case of Samuel Slater, often called the father of the American industrial revolution, who brought British textile designs to the United States in the late 1700s.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nStill, as China comes up with its own innovations, the country\u2019s leaders are embracing stricter laws on patents, copyrights and trademarks.\n\nThe government has created specialized courts to handle intellectual property disputes and awarded subsidies to entrepreneurs who file patent applications. In 2015, more than a million were filed, a record amount.\n\nLi Jian, a vice president of Beijing East IP, a Chinese law firm, said mainland companies increasingly saw strong intellectual property protections as a tool to help protect inventions and earn royalties overseas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMany Chinese companies have realized that through patent protection they can gain an advantage in the market,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cThey have more faith now in the Chinese government to protect their intellectual property.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe rules have also benefited some foreign firms. New Balance won a landmark case this year against a Chinese company that used its signature slanting \u201cN\u201d logo. China\u2019s highest court last year gave Michael Jordan the rights to Chinese characters of his name.\n\nEnforcement is still inconsistent, experts say. Local officials are often reluctant to aid foreign companies, worried about jeopardizing tax revenues from homegrown companies.\n\nThe Made in China 2025 initiative is a key reason the country is improving intellectual property rights. The plan focuses on sectors like electric cars, robotics, semiconductors and artificial intelligence.\n\nBy forcing foreign companies to hand over more technology and encouraging local companies to make new products based on that technology, Chinese leaders hope to cement the country\u2019s dominance in critical fields. They also see an opportunity to dictate the terms of the future development of technology and extract licensing fees from foreign firms that use Chinese-made technology.\n\nSeveral trade organizations and governments have said the plan is protectionist. Some have called for reciprocity, arguing that the United States should impose on Chinese companies the same restrictions China places on foreign companies.\n\n\u201cThere is an unmistakable national policy to boost the position of Chinese companies in cutting-edge areas,\u201d said William P. Alford, a Harvard law professor and an expert on Chinese intellectual property laws.\n\nChinese experts have defended the strategy.\n\n\u201cTo become an adult, you have to accumulate knowledge,\u201d said Professor Zhang, of Peking University. \u201cIt\u2019s the same for a country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs China\u2019s power has grown, Chinese companies have started using intellectual property laws to fend off foreign rivals.\n\nWhen the United States International Trade Commission last year began investigating Chic Intelligent Technology Company, a manufacturer of self-balancing scooters based in the eastern city of Hangzhou, the company\u2019s executives fought back. The commission was looking into claims that Chic had copied product designs of a California-based competitor, Razor USA.\n\nChic filed retaliatory lawsuits against American competitors, adopting many of the tactics that American companies have used for years to hobble Chinese competitors. The trade commission has since declined to ban imports of the Chic scooters. The lawsuit against Razor USA remains unresolved, according to Chic.\n\nChic made clear that it saw the investigation as an effort by the United States to use intellectual property laws to bully Chinese companies. In a statement, the company\u2019s leaders compared American regulators to Japanese invaders during World War II.\n\n\u201cThe crazier the enemy,\u201d the statement said, \u201cthe more we need to prove the necessity of our siege.\u201d",

        "text": "Photo\n\nIf President Trump lives up to his slogan of making America great again, there will be many more workers in factories, mines and the like. And they will need clothing, durable threads that are not necessarily fashionable.\n\nBy this logic, $24 billion VF Corporation \u2014 owner of the North Face, Nautica and Timberland brands \u2014 has just pulled off the signature apparel deal of the Trump era: an $820 million purchase of Dickies.\n\nTrue, Mr. Trump has not passed economic legislation of any significance since taking office in January. But he has been helped by a United States economy whose rate of growth, though not measurably higher than a year ago, has added around 191,000 new manufacturing, mining and construction jobs so far this year. Dickies also sells to the services and health care industries, which added some 300,000 jobs.\n\nBut there are other factors that justify VF\u2019s purchase of family-owned Williamson-Dickie Manufacutring. Alongside its new owner\u2019s Wrangler, Timberland Pro Series and Red Kap brands, Dickies will give VF a leading position in what it calls the global workwear marketplace, which it estimates is a $30 billion-a-year opportunity. VF expects Dickies sales to rise about 4 percent a year to over $1 billion in 2021.\n\nOn that basis, the acquisition is also financially savvy. VF says it can raise Dickies\u2019 operating margin to about 14 percent, roughly double its current level, if below the profitability of its own workwear division.\n\nThat would generate some $105 million of after-tax profit, suggesting a rough return on investment of more than 12 percent after four years. That alone merits taking a flier on making America great again.",

        "text": "Two examples of the president\u2019s efforts and the underlying support for his positions illustrate these trends.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Wednesday, he offered his support for a bill that would cut legal immigration to the United States in half, saying \u201cthis legislation demonstrates our compassion for struggling American families who deserve an immigration system that puts their needs first and that puts America first.\u201d To achieve its goal, the plan would limit entry for some family members of American citizens and permanent residents.\n\nIn explaining how limiting the entry of relatives would put the needs of American families first, a White House policy adviser, Stephen Miller, said it was \u201ccommon sense\u201d that immigration was costing Americans jobs. He then suggested that the family members who would be denied entry under the proposal were largely low-skill workers who were taking jobs away from struggling Americans.\n\nThe claim about who, if anyone, suffers from the immigration of low-skilled workers is nuanced. Debate on the question is active. If people come to America because they have a relative living here, it does not mean by definition that they are low-skilled workers. Despite the difficulty of nailing down the effects of low-skilled immigration on American families, public opinion on the topic \u2014 at least for a particular set of Americans \u2014 may reflect the \u201ccommon sense\u201d Mr. Miller described.\n\nIn January 2016, the American National Election Study asked 875 white Americans this question: How likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead? On average, 28 percent of the white population thought it was extremely or very likely that white people could not find work because of minorities seeking those same jobs. Roughly half the white population thought it was at least moderately or slightly likely. Only 21 percent thought this was not at all likely.\n\nDifferences emerge across party lines, even among whites. Close to 20 percent of Democrats thought it was extremely likely that the prospects for white job-seekers would be threatened by the presence of minority workers, while 34 percent of Republicans (and 30 percent of independents) felt this way.\n\nAmong white Republicans and independents, an even greater divide becomes clear: White voters who preferred Mr. Trump to one of the other candidates in the Republican field were nearly twice as likely to anticipate white job loss to nonwhite workers (48 percent compared with 24 percent).\n\nPhoto\n\nThe survey also asked white people how important it was for whites to work together to change laws that are unfair to whites. On average, 38 percent said it was extremely or very important. Only a quarter thought it was not important at all \u2014 a category that presumably also encompasses people who thought no such laws existed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese trends also help to frame President Trump\u2019s other recent announcement that the Justice Department would be investigating college admissions procedures that might discriminate against white applicants.\n\nThe difference between white Democrats and Republicans on the importance of uniting as a group against discriminatory laws is only five percentage points, with Republicans believing it was more important than Democrats and independents.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Nearly 60 percent of Mr. Trump\u2019s primary supporters thought organizing to change laws that are unfair to white people was extremely or very important. Only 15 percent thought it was not important at all to do so. Supporters of other G.O.P. candidates, on average, were about half as concerned.\n\nThe data show that race is less important to white Americans\u2019 sense of self than to nonwhites \u2014 more white people say being white is not at all important to their identity relative to the numbers who say so in other groups. But Mr. Trump\u2019s continued efforts to remind white Americans of their group status may increase the number of white people who think of themselves through a racial lens. It is one of the ways that his campaign and presidency may reshape public opinion and politics.\n\nHe is capitalizing both on an existing sense of threat among white voters and the opportunity to shape the way whites \u2014 because of their group membership \u2014 think of themselves.",

She shifted the blame to Congress, saying: \u201cI think it\u2019s clear that the end game is for Congress to do its job and actually pass legislation.

At times, he has been unable to contain his exasperation with the administration, saying at one point that the White House was in a \u201cdownward spiral.\u201d\n\nBut he has also spoken highly of the president, praising Mr. Trump\u2019s first foreign trip for having been \u201cexecuted to near perfection.\u201d As the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Corker has a powerful perch in the Senate, and the administration has no choice but to work with him.\n\nOn Friday, Tennessee\u2019s senior senator, Lamar Alexander, a Republican, offered a vote of confidence in the relationship between the president and Mr. Corker.\n\n\u201cThere is no senator \u2014 no Republican senator \u2014 who President Trump talks to more than Bob Corker,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cI know that for a fact. They have great respect for one another, so my reaction is maybe it\u2019s time for them to play another round of golf together.\u201d\n\nJoe Carr, a former Republican state representative in Tennessee who said he was considering running for the Senate next year, when Mr. Corker could seek a third term, took exception to Mr. Corker\u2019s criticism of Mr. Trump. \u201cYou don\u2019t publicly shame and humiliate the president,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt just seems those Republican establishment globalists like Bob Corker have an agenda to change the president by any means necessary,\u201d said Mr. Carr, who won about 40 percent of the vote when he challenged Mr. Alexander in a primary in 2014. \u201cI want the president to resist that influence and stick to his promises.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s distance from the Republican Party was noted by the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, which has often been supportive of his agenda.\n\n\u201cA biographer says Donald Trump once told him that he informed second wife Marla Maples he was seeking a divorce by leaking it to The New York Post,\u201d The Journal said in an editorial on Friday. \u201cPresident Trump now seems to be using Twitter to tell Republicans in Congress that he\u2019s divorcing them, or at least seeking a trial separation, and for its own self-preservation the G.O.P.

According to my colleagues Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D. Shear, he has \u201csigned 13 bills to wipe out Obama-era regulations using the Congressional Review Act and ordered agency reviews of regulations across the government.\u201d\n\nPeter C. Kenny, chief market strategist for Global Markets Advisory Group and independent market strategist at Kenny & Company, wrote on Monday, \u201cIt appears as though the Trump administration\u2019s focus on what it can control (i.e., rolling back Obama-era regulations) is effectively beginning to bear results in the form of economic resurgence.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not right. Listen to the earnings conference calls of the biggest publicly traded companies over the past several weeks \u2014 which are the real reason the stock market has soared \u2014 and virtually none of those phone calls attributed higher profits to reduced costs to comply with regulations.\n\nThe only time the word \u201cregulation\u201d was even used on Apple\u2019s earnings call \u2014 during which the company described how it beat analysts\u2019 estimates by a wide margin \u2014 was in reference to China. The word did not get a mention on Amazon\u2019s earnings call, nor was there any reference to Washington at all, despite constant chatter about how antitrust policy should be applied to the retailing behemoth.\n\nEven on Goldman Sachs\u2019s earnings call, which included several questions and answers related to regulations, not once did any official suggest that the firm\u2019s earnings were a result of lighter regulatory burdens. Indeed, the bank warned several times that it was too early and too difficult to predict exactly how deregulation efforts would affect its various businesses.\n\nJamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, famously was so upset on his conference call about the state of Washington and the inability to get anything done, he declared: \u201cWe have become one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Already, prosecutors have sought less in fines from the banks than they did under the Obama administration. And Mr. Trump has pledged to repeal \u2014 or at least reform \u2014 Dodd-Frank, the checks on the banking system imposed in the wake of the most recent financial crisis, but that would require legislation.\n\n\u201cThe administration is, at a minimum, telling a one-sided story \u2014 it\u2019s a bit disingenuous,\u201d Charles Campbell, managing director at MKM Partners, said about Mr. Trump and his team\u2019s taking credit for the rising stock market. \u201cFor the average American who is uninformed, it probably passes\u201d as sounding correct, he lamented.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Campbell said it was \u201ca little early\u201d for companies to see direct benefits from deregulation efforts. \u201cThis is the first full reporting period, quite honestly,\u201d since Mr. Trump took office, he noted.\n\nIn industries like finance, Mr. Campbell said, stocks are trading with the expectation that there will be business-friendly changes in the regulatory environment. \u201cIt is the anticipation that there will be an effect,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is very true that Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda should eventually make its way into the earnings reports of United States companies, but to suggest that it has already happened is a stretch.\n\nThe larger issue is, when it does happen, how much can deregulation really help juice the economy?\n\nThe answer will not satisfy those who have been clamoring for a change in policy.\n\nAccording to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who served in the George W. Bush administration and advised Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, deregulatory efforts will not do nearly as much as some people assume.\n\nHe contends that the \u201cObama-era regulatory explosion imposed a cumulative $890 billion in additional compliance costs on the private sector.\u201d And he adds, \u201cSome have argued that getting rid of the regulations would raise gross domestic product by just exactly that: $890 billion.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub: It isn\u2019t that simple, in large part because a huge amount of that figure is a transfer in wealth to comply with the regulations. Mr. Holtz-Eakin estimates the real savings of deregulation are more like $225 billion.\n\n\u201cIf gradually achieved over 10 years, that translates into an additional 0.1 percentage point in growth,\u201d he writes. \u201cWhile not exactly chump change, it highlights the difficulty in substantially moving the long-term rate of economic growth.\u201d",

For most of American history mainline Protestants \u2014 the Episcopalians, Methodists, Presbyterians and so on \u2014 set the dominant cultural tone. Most of the big social movements, like abolitionism, the suffragist movement and the civil rights movement, came out of the mainline churches.\n\nAs Joseph Bottum wrote in \u201cAn Anxious Age,\u201d mainline Protestants created a kind of unifying culture that bound people of different political views. You could be Catholic, Jewish, Muslim or atheist, but still you were influenced by certain mainline ideas \u2014 the Protestant work ethic, the WASP definition of a gentleman. Leaders from Theodore Roosevelt to Barack Obama hewed to a similar mainline standard for what is decent in public life and what is beyond the pale.\n\nOver the last several decades mainline Protestantism has withered. The country became more diverse. The WASPs lost their perch atop society. The mainline denominations lost their vitality.\n\nFor a time, we lived off the moral capital of the past. But the election of Trump shows just how desiccated the mainline code has become. A nation guided by that ethic would not have elected a guy who is a daily affront to it, a guy who nakedly loves money, who boasts, who objectifies women, who is incapable of hypocrisy because he acknowledges no standard of propriety other than that which he feels like doing at any given moment.\n\nDonald Trump has smashed through the behavior standards that once governed public life. His election demonstrates that as the unifying glue of the mainline culture receded, the country divided into at least three blocks: white evangelical Protestantism that at least in its public face seems to care more about eros than caritas; secular progressivism that is spiritually formed by feminism, environmentalism and the quest for individual rights; and realist nationalism that gets its manners from reality TV and its spiritual succor from in-group/out-group solidarity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf Trump falls in disgrace or defeat, and people\u2019s partisan pride is no longer at stake, I hope that even his supporters will have enough moral memory to acknowledge that character really does matter. A guy can promise change, but if he is dishonest, disloyal and selfish, the change he delivers is not going to be effective or good.\n\nBut where are people going to go for a new standard of decency? They\u2019re not going to go back to the old WASP ideal. That\u2019s dead. Trump revealed the vacuum, but who is going to fill it and with what?\n\nI could describe a similar vacuum when it comes to domestic policy thinking, to American identity, to America\u2019s role in the world. Trump exposes the void but doesn\u2019t fill it. That\u2019s why the reaction against Trump is now more important than the man himself.\n\nOne way or another I\u2019m gonna wash that man right outta what\u2019s left of my hair.",

Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments showed that he \u201clacks the temperament and judgment to deal with the serious crisis the United States confronts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should not be engaging in the same kind of blustery and provocative statements as North Korea about nuclear war,\u201d Mr. Cardin added.\n\nMr. Trump is well known for using harsh language, threats and taunts against adversaries when it comes to domestic matters, often using his Twitter feed as a weapon. But he has mostly been more careful on the international front, leaving his utterances about North Korea vague, though last month he ridiculed Mr. Kim after one of his missile launches, saying, \u201cDoes this guy have anything better to do with his life?\u201d\n\nVictor Cha, a former National Security Council official who holds the Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the closest an American president had come to Mr. Trump\u2019s bellicose language was when Bill Clinton declared in 1993 during a speech in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea that if Pyongyang ever used nuclear weapons, \u201cit would be the end of their country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI take Trump\u2019s statement in the same spirit,\u201d Mr. Cha said, describing the president\u2019s comments not as the promise of an American attack but as a warning of the consequences if the North were to use a nuclear weapon or intercontinental ballistic missile. It sounded, Mr. Cha said, like \u201ca message of deterrence, which is important now to avoid any miscalculation.\u201d\n\nMr. Feaver said the explosive statement put Mr. Trump on a \u201crisky path\u201d because of its potential to inflame Mr. Kim, but was in keeping with his penchant for upending the established protocols of diplomacy in efforts to bring about a better outcome.\n\n\u201cThey may be saying, \u2018Look, we have a 30-year record of bipartisan failure on this issue, so let\u2019s flip the script and give North Korea a bit of its own medicine and see if we can get a different result,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feaver said.\n\nBut breaking with tradition can have perilous consequences when bombs and missiles are involved.\n\n\u201cIf this was impulsive, that would be very much out of the history of the presidency on matters like this,\u201d Mr. Beschloss said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have presidents blurting out things when lives are at stake, and if that is what it was, it would be scary.\u201d",

        "text": "Unlike in the United States, where far-right extremists are free to brandish the emblematic red flags emblazoned with the black swastika against a white circle, all Nazi symbols, including the stiff-armed \u201cHitler salute,\u201d are banned in Germany and Austria. Anyone displaying them can be fined.\n\nA 41-year-old American who gave the salute in a bar in Dresden on Saturday is under investigation for his actions, the police there said. The man, who was not identified in keeping with German privacy law, suffered light injuries in a scuffle that followed his gesture, the police said. His assailant could also face charges.\n\nDespite having some of the world\u2019s strictest laws to limit far-right expression, Germany has struggled for decades with domestic neo-Nazi groups. Last year saw nearly 22,000 attacks motivated by far-right sentiment, a 42 percent increase from 2015, according to the domestic intelligence agency. Many of those attacks targeted recently arrived refugees and their shelters or homes.\n\nIn London, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said the British government condemned \u201cracism, hatred and violence\u201d and singled out the far right for specific criticism. Her spokesman, James Slack, in a briefing to reporters, avoided any direct critique of President Trump, and said that the president\u2019s comments were \u201ca matter for\u201d Mr. Trump alone.\n\nMrs. May, who is currently on vacation, has been accused by some critics of trying to ingratiate herself with Mr. Trump in the hope of building stronger trading ties with the United States after Britain\u2019s planned withdrawal from the European Union.\n\nItaly\u2019s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, also denounced the violence in Virginia, writing on Twitter that such condemnation \u201cunites all the world.

Last month, an article by a Vatican-vetted journal accused ultraconservative American Catholics of joining with right-wing evangelicals in an alliance of \u201chate\u201d to support Mr. Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMarcelo Figueroa, an author of the essay and an Argentine Presbyterian minister close to Pope Francis, responded to a comment by Franklin Graham, the president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, who cast \u201cshame on the politicians who are trying to push blame\u201d onto Mr. Trump. \u201cFor me. Sadness for the religious that attenuated responsibilities do not contribute to true peace,\u201d Mr. Figueroa wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn China, where the government often highlights social tensions in the United States as a way of undermining democratic ideals, state-run news outlets prominently featured the violence in Charlottesville.\n\nOne article proclaimed, \u201cFire and fury has erupted in America,\u201d echoing a threat Mr. Trump made against North Korea last week. Another article showed pictures of people holding torches under the words \u201cIs this still America?\u201d\n\nWith relations between the United States and China growing increasingly tense over issues like North Korea and trade, several commentators portrayed the Charlottesville episode as a sign of American chaos, contrasting it with the relative stability of China\u2019s tightly controlled society.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s superpower is increasingly mired in chaos,\u201d said an opinion piece in Global Times, a state-run publication that specializes in scathing critiques of the West. \u201cThe source of global instability may not be North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions nor Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, but the chaos in the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe article added: \u201cThe power struggle in the 21st century is not entirely about technology, the military or economy. Social stability carries more weight.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump was widely criticized in the United States for his reluctance to criticize white supremacists, Russian commentators seemed more forgiving.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a segment on the Charlottesville episode, Rossiya-24, a state television channel, reported that while Mr. Trump was being blamed for the unrest, \u201cthe aggravation of the situation with rough justice by police against the black population\u201d began under President Barack Obama.\n\nOther outlets were more critical. Moskovsky Komsomolets, a Moscow-based tabloid, called Charlottesville \u201cthe capital of fascism\u201d and speculated about \u201cWhy Trump is silent.\u201d\n\nIn a Facebook post on Sunday, the Russian Embassy in Washington warned visitors not to travel to Charlottesville, citing \u201cdisturbances\u201d in the area.",

This week, Mr. Cohn decided to remain in his job, believing he could be more effective as a public servant inside the White House than out of it.\n\nHe is one of the few Jewish members in the administration who have publicly condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about Charlottesville, although he has quietly disagreed with the president on a number of policy matters.\n\nAs Mr. Trump stood by his equivocal comments on Charlottesville and business leaders left presidential advisory panels in protest, Mr. Cohn told The Financial Times, he felt \u201cenormous pressure\u201d to step down. Various friends, and Mr. Cohn\u2019s wife, were at one point among those who were urging him to resign, said several people familiar with their advice.\n\nA senior administration official said the president was not surprised by Mr. Cohn\u2019s remarks to The Financial Times. Another official said the sentiments had been relayed clearly to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Cohn had said that if asked, he would say how he felt.\n\nBut on Friday, Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, tweeted that Mr. Cohn \u201cshould be fired immediately for his public attack on the president.\u201d In his tweet, Mr. Stone misspelled the name of Mr. Cohn, whom he has aggressively criticized, and said the economic adviser was \u201crecommended for his White House job by Jared Kushner.\u201d\n\nIt is highly unusual for a senior member of any presidential administration to publicly discuss the possibility of stepping down. Geoff Garin, a veteran Democratic pollster who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, said even though Mr. Cohn did not criticize Mr. Trump by name in the Financial Times interview, \u201cthe comments are still very tough and very blunt, including his comments about the push-and-pull whether to stay and whether to go.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no effort to conceal the fact that what Trump said was wrong and troubling,\u201d Mr. Garin said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to think of very many precedents for somebody like that who is a high-ranking presidential adviser.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cohn told The Financial Times that \u201cas a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting \u2018Jews will not replace us\u2019 to cause this Jew to leave his job.\u201d\n\nBut the job has not been easy. For Mr. Cohn, said two people familiar with his thinking, every day at the White House requires a different calculus over how best to spend his political capital. Right now, these people said, he will focus on economic policies that he believes are essential to the stability of the markets and the United States work force \u2014 even when other issues worry him.\n\nNudging Mr. Trump toward a more free-trade stance that avoids harsh steps toward China and other economic partners is paramount, these people said. Part of that, they added, is opposing tariffs on steel, aluminum and other goods that might damage relationships with American allies.\n\nBut using political capital on those fights means avoiding others, even when the president espouses policies that run contrary to Mr. Cohn\u2019s own principles, the two people said. Among other things, they said, Mr. Cohn disagrees with the president\u2019s directive banning transgender people from joining the military, but will leave that fight to others.\n\nOn Aug. 17, with word of Mr. Cohn\u2019s unhappiness percolating on Wall Street, some traders and investors got jittery. Seeing Mr. Cohn as a key player in pushing forward the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts, some sold American stocks, pushing prices down.\n\nMr. Cohn, a onetime silver trader who eventually became president of Goldman Sachs, was struck by the market move, said two people familiar with his thinking. He continued to huddle with friends and family over what steps to take, attending meetings in Washington during the process.\n\nAt some point during the past 10 days, Mr. Cohn penned a tentative resignation letter, said the three people familiar with the draft. It was not immediately clear what day the letter was written, or if Mr. Trump was ever made aware of it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut during a private Aug. 18 meeting with the president at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., Mr. Cohn relayed his concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Charlottesville, said people with knowledge of the gathering. The exact details of the talk are not clear, but the president urged Mr. Cohn to stay.\n\n\u201cI have had numerous private conversations with the president on this topic,\u201d Mr. Cohn told The Financial Times, adding that \u201cI have not been bashful saying what I think.\u201d\n\nOne possible part of Mr. Cohn\u2019s calculus is the chance that he could be named Federal Reserve chairman early next year, a move Mr. Trump has said he is considering. Mr. Cohn has in the past expressed interest in the job, said two people close to him. But unlike past Fed chairmen, Mr. Cohn is not an economist, and some of his friends have said it is hard to imagine him in the more reserved, less dynamic environment of the Fed, which would be a huge contrast to the pace of Goldman Sachs or the White House.\n\nSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who also is Jewish, defended Mr. Trump in a statement a week ago, after more than 300 of his Yale classmates urged him in a letter to step down. At a briefing with reporters at the White House on Friday, Mr. Mnuchin, an old business partner of Mr. Trump who has at times clashed over policy with Mr. Cohn, told reporters that under no circumstances has he considered resigning.",

        "text": "In the 1980s, \u201cLate Night\u201d did not have an articulated political perspective, and while its host expressed liberal leanings later in his career, back then his ideological slant was as unclear as, well, that of Mr. Trump. What they also shared was a gift for stinging insults, so perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Mr. Trump\u2019s gibes found a receptive audience. Mr. Trump earned applause criticizing the city\u2019s management, the first of several times his political attacks resonated on Mr. Letterman\u2019s talk shows. \u201cListening to this stuff,\u201d Mr. Letterman said, \u201cit seems to me you are dying to get to some public platform to superimpose those feelings upon the American awareness.\u201d\n\nOne decade and a few appearances later, their conversation became chummier. On \u201cLate Show,\u201d Mr. Letterman asked Mr. Trump about the duty of the wealthy to give back. \u201cCould you give me an idea of something nice you\u2019ve done for someone recently?\u201d Mr. Letterman asked, a setup to perhaps talk about charity. Instead, Mr. Trump referred to his ex-wife Marla Maples: \u201cI married Marla, and now I\u2019m giving her a huge settlement.\u201d\n\nSay what you will about the etiquette or morality of this quip, but for the purposes of late-night comedy, it\u2019s hard to beat. Mr. Letterman chuckled, even looking a bit jealous. \u201cIf I had said that, people would have booed me,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter separating from Ms. Maples, Mr. Trump, who occasionally laughed on the show, something he rarely does in public today, offered to set Mr. Letterman up with her (\u201cI\u2019m going to wait and see how she makes out in the prenup,\u201d the host said). They bonded over being older fathers. \u201cGod forbid something happens to me, would you take my son?\u201d Mr. Letterman asked and Mr. Trump agreed: \u201cThat\u2019s called a great gene pool.\u201d\n\nIn Mr. Letterman\u2019s final decade in late night, when he leaned more on long-form conversation than scripted comedy, Mr. Trump acted as a pundit, hitting the same populist notes that became his campaign rhetoric. \u201cI don\u2019t see greatness unless we do something about China and some others,\u201d he said in 2010, adding that America should be sending businesspeople, not diplomats, to negotiate deals.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWith Mr. Trump, Mr. Letterman felt comfortable going long stretches without jokes, probing his thoughts on the issue of the day and treating him with more respect than he did a sparring partner like Bill O\u2019Reilly. Mr. Letterman took shots at Mr. Trump, but they were typically about his hair. The host treated their disagreements seriously, pushing back, for instance, when Mr. Trump praised coal instead of green energy. \u201cI\u2019d rather see the windmills than the choking clouds of coal smoke,\u201d Mr. Letterman responded.\n\nLater, when Mr. Trump argued that a mosque shouldn\u2019t be built near ground zero, Mr. Letterman protested, asking if we were at war with Muslims. Mr. Trump\u2019s response was so glib that you could miss its extremism: \u201cSomebody knocked down the World Trade Center.\u201d Mr. Letterman stood firm here, insisting the war is with terrorists, not Muslims. Mr. Trump conceded the point.\n\nMr. Letterman and Mr. Trump had such an amiable rapport that they could disagree heatedly without rancor. No conversation illustrates their kinship better than Mr. Trump\u2019s first appearance after Mr. Letterman, facing a blackmail threat, confessed to having affairs with staff members. On the show, Mr. Trump always expressed sympathy for whatever famous man was then battling scandal, including Mike Tyson, Rod Blagojevich and Woody Allen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere too Mr. Trump celebrated the \u201ctoughness\u201d of Mr. Letterman\u2019s response (the host pressed for an arrest), saying he wished more people would take Mr. Letterman\u2019s pugnacious approach. In a deep, deadpan voice full of anguish, Mr. Letterman, who was privately in pain over the scandal, responded to this support: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come home with me tonight, Don?\u201d\n\nEven though Mr. Trump\u2019s political success owes a debt to popular culture, no talk show, not even Mr. Fallon\u2019s, is responsible for his rise \u2014 and it\u2019s important to recall that until recently, few thought him a plausible presidential candidate.\n\nMr. Letterman has said he never did, but what\u2019s striking about the episode where he called Mr. Trump a racist is how seriously he took the comments about Barack Obama. \u201cNobody should be amused,\u201d Mr. Letterman told another guest, Dr. Phil, who made light of Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of the birther movement. Mr. Letterman wasn\u2019t having it: \u201cIt\u2019s all fun. It\u2019s all a circus. It\u2019s all a rodeo,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil it smacks of racism.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Trump was considered by many to be a diversion, Mr. Letterman approached Mr. Trump\u2019s outrageous comments with moral gravity. Mr. Letterman not only went further than Dr. Phil, who said he didn\u2019t think Mr. Trump was a racist, but argued earlier than most that what Mr. Trump was doing merited a serious response, not just jokes. And yet, when Mr. Trump dug in after being criticized for making a norm-shattering comment, something he would go on to do many times, Mr. Letterman backed down. On the same show where Mr. Letterman apologized, Mr. Trump had barely sat down before noting it was the first day of sweeps. \u201cYou need me, David,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Letterman said that he was wrong to say Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t racist, and when he declared last week that Mr. Trump was on his wish list for an interview, it sounded as if he might be looking for a second chance.\n\n\u201cI have insight now that heretofore I did not have,\u201d Mr. Letterman told The Hollywood Reporter about Mr. Trump, adding later, \u201cWhat we need now is somebody like myself to sit down with him and calmly get him to sign some papers and then have him leave the White House.\u201d",

Speaking at a gathering this week in Kentucky, Mr. McConnell mounted a defense of the chamber\u2019s work, arguing that complicated legislation takes time.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason I think that the story line is that we haven\u2019t done much is because, in part, the president and others have set these early timelines about things need to be done by a certain point,\u201d the senator said. \u201cOur new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before. And I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process.\u201d\n\nThough he has generally been a loyal steward of the president\u2019s agenda, Mr. McConnell has tweaked him at times this year, including several pointed dismissals of Mr. Trump\u2019s calls to do away with the legislative filibuster.\n\nMr. McConnell has also repeatedly encouraged the president to tweet less.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republicans in Washington were reminded why, particularly as the party seeks to confront tax policy, a debt ceiling deadline and perhaps a revived health care repeal push when lawmakers return next month.\n\n\u201cAttacking the Senate majority leader of your own party is utterly incomprehensible and completely wrongheaded,\u201d said Michael Steel, a Republican strategist who was an aide to the former House speaker John A. Boehner and to Jeb Bush, a Republican presidential candidate in 2016. \u201cThere is no positive result for the president or his agenda in these attacks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is unclear how Mr. McConnell\u2019s remarks, made Monday at a Rotary Club event, hit the president\u2019s radar. As recently as Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump was deploying his Twitter account for a cause Mr. McConnell cherishes, endorsing Senator Luther Strange, Republican of Alabama, a week before his Republican primary in a special election. Mr. McConnell has been seeking to boost Mr. Strange, who took office after Mr. Trump named Jeff Sessions as his attorney general.",

But it was speedy compared with the all-nighter in November 2003, when the House approved a bill adding prescription drug benefits to Medicare. That vote started at 3 a.m. and lasted nearly three hours as Republican leaders quashed an uprising by committed conservatives.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats basically knew what they wanted: a government guarantee of health insurance for all Americans. They disagreed on some important details. But Democrats had much more consensus than today\u2019s Republicans.\n\nThe differences between President Trump and Mr. Obama are obvious. Mr. Trump floated above the gritty details of health policy and took occasional jabs at Republicans slaving over the issue. Mr. Obama immersed himself in the details, and his top aides occasionally reached out to journalists to provide tart-tongued tutorials on the politics of health care.\n\nIn some ways, the collapse of Republican efforts to uproot the Affordable Care Act recalled the last days of the \u201cClinton Care\u201d effort to remake the American health care system. It appeared to be moribund, but its champions vowed to keep trying. It finally expired on the Senate floor in 1994. (That defeat inspired Democrats to try again 15 years later.)\n\nThe four rounds of health care legislating have one thing in common: the passion that surrounds the issue.\n\nCancer survivors, children with disabilities and young adults with diseases converged on Congress in a bid to save the Affordable Care Act. Lawmakers, listening to their stories, were clearly moved. I had never heard members of Congress speak with such empathy on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries or drug addicts, whose treatment was financed by Medicaid.\n\nBut for every such testimonial, Republicans could cite reports from constituents aggrieved by the law: people who said they were spending more on health insurance premiums than on home mortgage payments, and \u201cvictims of Obamacare\u201d who could not afford to use their insurance because the deductibles were so high.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe lawmakers were, in a sense, deciding who would live and who would die \u2014 but they had alternate versions of reality that could simply not be reconciled.",

        "text": "But his career as a political consultant has been short and checkered. As the president has observed, Mr. Bannon did not join Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign until August 2016, by which time Mr. Trump had secured the Republican nomination. Mr. Trump\u2019s general election victory was remarkable. It was also something of a black-swan event. There is a tendency, especially among Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, to overlook the fact that, had some 79,000 votes in three states gone the other way, the winner of the popular vote would now be in the White House.\n\nSince his inauguration, President Trump\u2019s numbers have steadily declined. He is at 39 percent approval and at 55 percent disapproval in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. The low standing depletes Mr. Trump\u2019s political capital and his leverage over Congress. It endangers Republican control of one or both legislative chambers. Perhaps it is time to take advice from someone else.\n\nOf course, Mr. Trump does not seem inclined to listen to anyone at all. That is even more reason not to exaggerate Mr. Bannon\u2019s influence. Mr. Bannon may have encouraged Mr. Trump to follow his instincts, but that is precisely the point: Mr. Trump\u2019s natural inclinations are in perfect harmony with the voters he refers to in casual conversation as \u201cmy people.\u201d Mr. Bannon may have encouraged Mr. Trump not to back down from his positions on the violence in Charlottesville and on the place of statuary memorializing the Confederacy. But the final decision, like all decisions in this White House, was Mr. Trump\u2019s alone.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

He has a reputation as a well-read autodidact whose syncretic worldview is the result of years of independent and wide-ranging study.\n\nBut he is a terrible colleague. His unprompted interview last week with the editor of a liberal magazine not only demonstrated a na\u00efve willingness to forge alliances with the economic left on trade and infrastructure. It also confirmed everything that has been said about Mr. Bannon: He disparages his co-workers behind their backs; he postures as the force behind personnel decisions; and he pretends to know more about national security than James Mattis, John Kelly, H. R. McMaster and Joseph Dunford (not to mention Donald Trump).\n\nThe conflicting reports about the timing and method of Mr. Bannon\u2019s fall, whether he was fired or resigned, whether he knew he was on his way out or was suddenly expelled, are additional signs of his habit of manipulating the press for his personal benefit.\n\n\u201cThe Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,\u201d Mr. Bannon said in an interview with The Weekly Standard on Friday. \u201cWe still have a huge movement, and we will make something of this Trump presidency. But that presidency is over.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has told close associates that he believes Steve Bannon is behind damaging leaks about White House colleagues,\u201d Axios.com reported last week. The American Prospect interview made Mr. Trump\u2019s suspicions impossible to doubt.\n\nThe costs of Mr. Bannon\u2019s presence in the West Wing outweighed the benefits. You can\u2019t have an underling raise the white flag in the middle of a nuclear standoff with North Korea. You can\u2019t tell Mr. Kelly to impose order on the staff while allowing Mr. Bannon to run around D.C. impugning the men and women who stand in his way. You can\u2019t begin to rebuild your presidency with Mr. Bannon on payroll.\n\nBetween May 9, when he fired the F.B.I. director, James Comey, and Aug. 15, when he said there were good people \u201con both sides\u201d of the clash between racists and antifa, or anti-fascists, Mr. Trump has done more damage to himself and to his office than any president in memory. Whatever hopes he has of salvaging his presidency begin in suppressing the infighting, factionalism, subversion, dysfunction and flirtations with extremism within his inner circle.\n\nThe myth of Steve Bannon\u2019s power may live on. But the reality is that Mr. Trump no longer needs him and is unlikely to be harmed by Mr. Bannon\u2019s sniping.\n\nThe connection between Mr. Trump and the forces Mr. Bannon represents is visceral and durable. To save his presidency, though, Mr. Trump must join with another, far larger constituency: the American people.",

I think in the long run depriving China\u2019s people of freedom, a basic human right, will undermine their ability to realize their full potential.\n\nBut it has worked better than expected, up to now, because China\u2019s leaders are just as focused on asking a second question: What world are we living in?

For seven years the G.O.P. made replacing Obamacare, which needs improving, its top goal, and when it finally controlled all the levers of power, it was clear that it had done no homework on a better plan or built any intraparty consensus for it. It was all a fraud.\n\nAnd then you look at all the knife fights between rival Trump aides and you realize that none of these fights were over how to thrive in a world challenged by these three climate changes. They were all about who could get closest to and flatter our Dear Leader most. But our Dear Leader \u2014 as we saw in the health care debate \u2014 has done no homework on the future, either. He\u2019s been too busy promising to restore the past.\n\nThis is so dangerous. When the pace of change accelerates in climate, technology and globalization all at once, small errors in leadership navigation can have huge consequences. It\u2019s like a 747 pilot who enters the wrong navigational coordinates. You can find yourself so far off course that the pain of getting back will be staggering.\n\nWe have such a pilot. It is time for the adult Republicans and Democrats in Congress to come together and take the helm.",

Presumably, the rest of the signatories will insist on maintaining the deal, setting off a cascade of diplomatic and economic recriminations against Europe and souring relations for years to come.\n\nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s what decertification would mean for the Middle East, and the likelihood of a renewed showdown with Tehran. Mr. Trump has already taken steps to isolate Iran, aligning closely with Saudi Arabia and right-wing forces in Israel, who have long made torpedoing any agreement a key goal in their relationships with Washington.\n\nMr. Trump seems eager to please them, even at the risk of regional destabilization. Granted, Tehran has capitalized on regional unrest to extend its influence. But decertifying Iran would almost certainly increase the already considerable suspicion and hostility between Tehran and Washington \u2014 and this time, America will not be able to count on Europe, Russia, China and the rest of the world as a diplomatic partner. This would be a high price to pay for aligning the United States with our Gulf allies in a Saudi-inspired attempt to settle scores with Tehran.\n\nFinally, when the president starts directing his White House staff to concoct facts and arguments for ill-considered policies, that is usually a sign of bad things, including illegal acts, to come.\n\nBoth Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cplumbers\u201d and Ronald Reagan\u2019s Iran-contra fiasco began with a president frustrated by laws, facts or conditions he could not control. More recently, George W. Bush\u2019s White House, bent on removing Saddam Hussein from power, cherry-picked intelligence in making a case for the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and trying to establish a link between Hussein, Al Qaeda and the Sept. 11 attacks. Under circumstances like these, somewhere, someone, is likely to step \u2014 or be pushed \u2014 over the legal line.\n\nWhen that happened in the Nixon and Reagan White Houses, one president was forced to resign when the White House tapes confirmed he had personally directed illegal actions; the other saved himself by convincing the American people that he was unaware of the illegal shenanigans happening within his White House walls, aided by senior advisers unwilling to turn on their boss. President Bush left office with his, and America\u2019s, credibility in tatters and Iran\u2019s influence over the region growing rapidly.\n\nWith recertification being gamed to wreck the nuclear deal, the clock will start ticking on President Trump, too.",

Under the program, which was in development before Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory, the Canadian government has promised to approve two-year visas in less than two weeks \u2014 blindingly fast, compared with the process in the United States.\n\nAnd unlike the H-1B visa in the United States, there is no limit to the number of Canadian visas available.\n\nBeyond that, Ontario is in the early stages of preparing a social media campaign for technology executives around the world to sell the province as a place for investment.\n\n\u201cCanada is seizing its moment,\u201d said Navdeep Singh Bains, the country\u2019s federal minister of innovation, science and economic development. \u201cWe\u2019re open to trade and people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Mexico, states with growing regional tech hubs, like Jalisco, have been redoubling their efforts to attract talent and investment in recent months, peddling a philosophy of openness that departs from what Mr. Sandoval called Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cxenophobia\u201d and \u201clack of global vision.\u201d\n\nThe efforts have included visits by Jalisco officials to the San Francisco Bay Area and to Europe. The San Francisco Chronicle published an op-ed piece by Mr. Sandoval pitching the advantages of doing business in his state.\n\nThe officials herald Mexico\u2019s proximity to Silicon Valley, its alignment with time zones in the United States and its lower cost of living. They are also sweetening the invitation with enticements like tax incentives and promises of full government cooperation.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe want you,\u201d says a new promotional website, Come2Jalisco.com. \u201cInnovation has no borders.\u201d\n\nEven Mexico\u2019s ambassador to India has echoed the pitch.\n\n\u201cWe will be more than happy to have Indians relocate to Mexico,\u201d the ambassador, Melba Pr\u00eda, told The Indian Express newspaper earlier this year, emphasizing the \u201cvisa ease\u201d that foreign talent will experience in Mexico.\n\nChina\u2019s tech leaders have also been seizing on the opportunity created by Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nWang Huiyao, founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization, a research group in Beijing, said Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine was a boon for China\u2019s efforts to attract foreign tech talent and persuade Chinese engineers now working abroad to return home.\n\n\u201cChina is shifting from attracting foreign capital to foreign talent,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cThe U.S. is losing out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong the Chinese voices leading the push is that of Robin Li, the chief of Baidu, China\u2019s largest search engine.\n\n\u201cMany entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley have expressed their concern that this will hurt America\u2019s field of innovation,\u201d Mr. Li said recently at China\u2019s World Internet Conference. \u201cI really hope that talent from all over the world comes to China.\u201d\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France has sought to throw open a slightly different door. When Mr. Trump announced that he was pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord, Mr. Macron extended an unusual offer to Americans: \u201cTo all scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, responsible citizens who were disappointed by the decision of the president of the United States, I want to say that they will find in France a second home.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThese messages of welcome stand in contrast to the Trump administration\u2019s tough approach to immigration.\n\nIn an executive order this spring, Mr. Trump directed federal agencies to review immigration laws with an eye toward ending what he called \u201cthe theft of American prosperity.\u201d\n\nThe president has taken particular aim at the H-1B visa program, under which the government admits 85,000 highly skilled foreign workers every year, most of them in the tech field.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In some cases, the jobs themselves went back home with the new workers.\n\nCanada revised its temporary visa program partly because the Royal Bank of Canada, the country\u2019s largest financial institution, shuffled jobs overseas using that technique.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s executive order made no immediate changes, but it has sowed concern throughout the industry. Competition for H-1B visas was already intense. The government received 199,000 applications in the first five days of its lottery this year, then stopped accepting them. Many companies fear that Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts might put highly skilled immigrant workers even further out of their reach.\n\nA change could favor the biggest American tech companies, which tend to pay the highest wages. But it could hurt some of the biggest users of the H-1B program \u2014 the outsourcing companies, including several from India \u2014 that bring thousands of workers to the United States on lower wages to handle computing tasks for banks, health care companies and other firms.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt could also hurt start-ups and smaller firms without the cash to compete on salaries.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, the Trump administration said last month that it would delay, and perhaps eliminate, an Obama-era rule allowing thousands of foreign entrepreneurs to move to the United States every year to build start-ups.\n\n\u201cPeople here are extremely nervous,\u201d said Andreas Kraemer, managing partner of MITA Ventures, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm. \u201cThis whole area is driven by immigration.\u201d\n\nThe White House referred questions about whether the uncertainty surrounding temporary visas could shift jobs to other countries to the Department of Homeland Security. The department declined to comment on Tuesday.\n\nLe\u00f3n David P\u00e9rez, president of Propulsar, a Mexico City-based company that develops tech start-ups and has an office in San Francisco, argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies could jeopardize Silicon Valley\u2019s culture of creativity.\n\n\u201cWhen you want to spur innovation, the best way to generate it is to employ the greatest diversity of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s being threatened with Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty in Silicon Valley \u2014 combined with the invitations from around the world \u2014 have already begun to lead some tech companies and entrepreneurs to rethink the gravitational pull of Silicon Valley.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBusiness interest in Jalisco has soared since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, leaders in the state\u2019s tech sector contend. Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies, said Jaime Reyes Robles, Jalisco\u2019s secretary of innovation, science and technology, have been \u201cour best marketing.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, Manuel R. Guti\u00e9rrez Novelo, a Mexican engineer, moved to Silicon Valley to develop TDVision Systems, a company specializing in 3D technology. He went on to develop a multipronged operation based in California, with offices in Europe and Asia.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut in recent weeks, he uprooted his businesses and moved them back to Guadalajara, his hometown. Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict immigration were a big reason, he said, calling them anathema to his company\u2019s philosophy and a potential barrier to hiring foreign workers.\n\n\u201cIf I saw Donald Trump, I\u2019d tell him he has lost my business,\u201d he said.\n\nFor decades, Jalisco was mainly a center for tech manufacturing. But as its talent pool has expanded, fed by highly regarded engineering programs at local universities, it has increasingly become a place for high-tech innovation.\n\nAndy Kieffer, an American entrepreneur who runs Agave Lab, a venture capital firm in Guadalajara, said that when he was seeking investors in Silicon Valley several years ago, he was waved off.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get anyone to look at Mexico,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey said, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t know anything about Mexico. It\u2019s off my radar.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut in the past several months, he said, interest among investors has shot up.\n\nIn Canada, officials expect their new visa to give their tech industry a big boost. Not only is there no limit on the number of visas, but government employees have been hired to act as visa concierges to make it easier for companies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge advantage when you contrast it to what\u2019s happening across the border,\u201d said Stephen Lake, whose company, Thalmic Labs, produces devices that enable users to control computers through gestures.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSharoon Thomas, an Indian entrepreneur, last year began shifting his start-up from Mountain View, Calif., to Toronto, and officially made the move in May. Seven of his engineers are still working in the United States and other countries, but he plans to use Canada\u2019s new visa program to bring them north.\n\n\u201cCanada\u2019s immigration policy makes you feel more welcome than the U.S.,\u201d said Mr. Thomas, whose company, fulfil.io, designs software to manage inventories.\n\nEvan J. Green, an immigration lawyer in Toronto, said he was helping companies in banking, insurance and retail seek visas for employees.\n\n\u201cThese people have options,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the best and the brightest of the world. We want these people. This is good for Canada. Let\u2019s keep the door open while they\u2019re slamming it shut south of the border.\u201d",

I hold myself accountable for that. I am increasingly concerned with accountability because our country is being led by a man who believes he is accountable only to himself and enriching his coffers rather than the more than 300 million people he was so narrowly elected to lead and serve.\n\nIt pains me to think about what could have been. It is even more difficult to face the way things are. Every single morning, I am tense as I check the news, wondering what the president has tweeted overnight. Throughout the day, my shoulders tense when I see a news alert about his latest misstep or his latest provocation to North Korea or his latest insult to the media whose adulation he so desperately craves.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBetween the election and the inauguration, I tried to imagine what a Trump presidency would look like. I tried to prepare for the worst. What has unfolded over the past seven months is far more terrible than I could have imagined. Advances made during the Obama era are being dismantled. I tell myself to remain hopeful but struggle to find a reason. And then I struggle to remind myself that despair is a luxury we cannot afford right now.\n\nA week ago in Charlottesville, Va., white men assembled to rage for a world long lost \u2014 one where their mediocrity was good enough. These were men emboldened by a president who shares their odious beliefs.\n\nI\u2019ve watched in horror as they\u2019ve been energized by his campaign and his presidency. It\u2019s possible that hate like this would have been on the rise anyway, given eight years of the Obama presidency and, animus toward Hillary Clinton. But now we don\u2019t have hate on the fringe; we have it reinforced in the White House.\n\nMost politicians, of all political persuasions, have released statements condemning racism and the violence in Charlottesville, violence that ended in the death of one person, Heather Heyer, and the injuring of many others. Even if these statements are political posturing, they must be made. Our leaders need to make crystal clear where they stand. Now, more than ever, everyone needs to be unequivocal about where they stand.\n\nUnfortunately, far too many people are being equivocal, including, most alarmingly, the president. In the days following the Charlottesville unrest, we have seen Mr. Trump reluctant to disavow white supremacy. The president resents that he, as the leader of the United States, is rightly expected to condemn hateful acts and ideas. Mr. Trump and far too many others believe there is more than one side to the story of Charlottesville. The president thinks that leftist resistance is as culpable as far-right white supremacy. He has lamented the removal of Confederate statues, tweeting that it is \u201csad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\u201d as if books and museums do not exist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen you look at the sum of his behavior, it\u2019s obvious that Mr. Trump is actually not equivocating. He is actively demonstrating that his loyalties lie with only some of the American people.\n\nThere are other forms of equivocating. Back in November, pundits began attributing Mr. Trump\u2019s win to \u201ceconomic anxiety,\u201d because they were unwilling to face the blatant racism that fueled his popularity. Look where that thinking has brought us. Everyone who says, \u201cThis is not America\u201d or \u201cThis is not us\u201d is being willfully ignorant of both the past and the present. We all need to acknowledge that yes, this is indeed us, the very worst of us. There are people who think it is a problem that the white supremacists from Charlottesville are being publicly identified and fired from their jobs, as if those who would eradicate all of us who are not Aryan deserve empathy. They do not. A white newscaster cries because talking about race makes her uncomfortable because discomfort is most likely the worst thing she can imagine.\n\nWe cannot afford to delude ourselves about the state of things. We cannot mollify ourselves with some ideal of neutrality or objectivity as if white supremacy deserves anything but resounding contempt. Taking down Confederate statues is a symbolic but necessary gesture, but we cannot merely dismantle these markers of America\u2019s painful past. We must work to dismantle the pernicious ideologies these statues represent. We must root out white supremacy, wherever it lurks, and call it by its name even when it makes us uncomfortable, even when the people we are calling out are those we live and work with, or consider friends and family.\n\nWe are on a precipice. What happened in Charlottesville is not the end of something but, rather, the beginning. And it is from this precipice that I am reminded of everything I did not do during the 2016 election. Hindsight reminds me that resistance must be active, and constant. Resistance is the responsibility of everyone who believes in equality and demands the eradication of racism, anti-Semitism and the hatred that empowers bigots to show their truest selves in broad daylight. I am reminding myself that I should never allow my fears to quiet me. I have a voice and I am going to use it, as loudly as I can.",

It has not been my habit to widely offer running commentary on current affairs, nor to presume to weigh in on the events of a given day save those that might be of particular or specific concern to 21CF and my colleagues,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut what we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe added: \u201cThese events remind us all why vigilance against hate and bigotry is an eternal obligation \u2014 a necessary discipline for the preservation of our way of life and our ideals. The presence of hate in our society was appallingly laid bare as we watched swastikas brandished on the streets of Charlottesville and acts of brutal terrorism and violence perpetrated by a racist mob. I can\u2019t even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.\u201d",

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMs. Williams is not registered in any political party, and she said last year that she did not vote for Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton for president. She said she had felt compelled to air her indignation with Mr. Trump in part because she believed her audience deserved a diversity of viewpoints.\n\n\u201cI felt utterly compelled in that moment, particularly as a black woman who works on Fox News Channel, and has the privilege and a responsibility to address an audience that otherwise doesn\u2019t necessarily get my point of view, or the point of view of people like me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey probably don\u2019t see much of any of the diverse point of view that I can offer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot every viewer has been pleased. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get to the remote soon enough\u201d to change the channel, one Twitter user wrote on Wednesday, after Ms. Williams again criticized Mr. Trump on the air. Another wrote: \u201cI wonder if @FoxNews now regrets the divisive hateful words spewed out of the nasty mouth\u201d of Ms. Williams.\n\nMr. Hannity and other anchors, including the morning show hosts on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d rarely question the president, and several of them recently dined with Mr. Trump at the White House. Rupert Murdoch, Fox News\u2019s executive chairman, is a regular adviser to Mr. Trump, even counseling him on the fate of Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has his critics on Fox News. Juan Williams regularly battles with his pro-Trump co-hosts on the prime-time show \u201cThe Five.\u201d The daytime news anchor Shepard Smith can offer up tough criticism. \u201cSo far we\u2019ve been unable to find the very fine people protesting with the white supremacists,\u201d he said sarcastically on Wednesday\u2019s broadcast, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that \u201cvery fine people\u201d were among the demonstrators in Charlottesville.\n\nMs. Williams\u2019s criticism was more scathing. Addressing Mr. Trump directly on the air Monday, she said: \u201cWhile you personally may not be a racist, President Trump, what you are is all too happy to reap the benefits of their support, and you even tacitly encourage them with evasive, irresponsible statements.\u201d\n\nMs. Williams, a lawyer who formerly worked at CBS News, said in the interview Wednesday that her superiors at Fox News had not expressed concern.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth, if they had said anything, it would have shocked me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m no puppet for the network. I call Fox as I see Fox. And for me it\u2019s been a positive experience. It\u2019s not been a perfect experience, but I\u2019m there because the good outweighs the bad.\u201d\n\nHer \u201cSpecialists\u201d co-host, the libertarian commentator Kat Timpf, has also drawn attention for criticizing Mr. Trump on the air, calling his news conference \u201cone of the biggest messes that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Specialists\u201d usually features the anchor Eric Bolling, who was suspended this month after HuffPost reported on accusations that he had sent lewd messages to co-workers. (Mr. Bolling has denied wrongdoing.) Ms. Williams acknowledged that his absence had created some uncertainty. \u201cThe future of our show hangs in the balance,\u201d she said.\n\nRumors have circulated that Fox News might reshuffle its schedule, adding Laura Ingraham in prime time and moving \u201cThe Five\u201d from 9 p.m. to 5 p.m., when \u201cThe Specialists\u201d now airs. Asked about the speculation, Ms. Williams said, \u201cYour guess would literally be quite as good as mine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe added: \u201cWe have no idea. They\u2019ve not told us or any of the other co-hosts or producers anything other than they believe in this show.\u201d",

The heyday of monument building, between 1890 and 1920, was also a time of extreme racial violence, as Southern whites pushed back against what little progress had been made by African-Americans in the decades after the Civil War. As monuments went up, so did the bodies of black men, women and children during a long rash of lynching.\n\nIn the civil rights era, segregationists again sought to push back any attempt to challenge white male supremacy. Once again, they rallied under the banner of the Confederate battle flag. But this time, local and state officials from law enforcement and state agencies like the Sovereignty Commission in Mississippi joined them in their effort.\n\nToday, the battle for white male supremacy has expanded in scope. It is nativist, anti-feminist and anti-Semitic. It is also homophobic. As always, it is racist. And it has fully embraced the imagery of Nazism, from Adolf Hitler to swastika flags to the Nazi salute.\n\nConfederate \u201cheritage,\u201d as a unifying theme for the white South, also obscures the way that white elites use the white working class to do their bidding by pitting them against those with whom they have more in common economically than those in power. The path for the rise of the Southern Democratic Party, known as the \u201cWhite Man\u2019s Party,\u201d was paved with racial violence. White elites showed their thanks by erecting Confederate monuments.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a Southern problem. The president of the United States has unleashed a new generation of domestic terrorists. During the presidential campaign, and now from the seat of power in the White House, Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of building a wall, his denigration of women, his ban on transgender soldiers and his circle of nationalist advisers embolden the very people who showed up in Charlottesville chanting, \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d Us, of course, are the dispossessed white, heterosexual men who long for a return to an imagined patriarchy where they have a seat at the head of the table, even though, in reality, those seats are reserved for white elites.\n\nAnd once again, rather than seeing clearly that Confederate monuments stand at the very center of the white-supremacist imagination, too many people are clouding the issue. Some of my fellow historians have na\u00efvely suggested that we need to keep them to teach us the darker lessons of Southern history.\n\nBut at what cost? What the events of this past weekend have made clear is that for several generations, the Lee monument and others like it have assisted the cause of white supremacy and the deadly violence that has accompanied it. This is why communities across the region have a moral obligation to take up the cause of removing them. Artifacts of hate will be lost, but their history and meaning will not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile what happened in Charlottesville is a stain on our nation, we should remain hopeful for the future. Those who gathered in the name of hatred and bigotry did so under the banners of defeated regimes. This does not bode well for their cause. Truly patriotic Americans, of all colors and creeds, can and should stand up to them as they did this past weekend. But we also need leadership at all levels of government to condemn not only their actions but also white supremacy itself.",

        "text": "When the tweeter-in-chief castigated Senate Republicans as \u201ctotal quitters\u201d for failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. In fact, they showed zombie-like relentlessness in their determination to take health care away from millions of Americans, shambling forward despite devastating analyses by the Congressional Budget Office, denunciations of their plans by every major medical group, and overwhelming public disapproval.\n\nPhoto\n\nPut it this way: Senator Lindsey Graham was entirely correct when he described the final effort at repeal as \u201cterrible policy and horrible politics,\u201d a \u201cdisaster\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d He voted for it anyway \u2014 and so did 48 of his colleagues.\n\nSo where did this zombie horde come from? Who ate Republicans\u2019 brains?\n\nAs many people have pointed out, when it came to health care Republicans were basically caught in their own web of lies. They fought against the idea of universal coverage, then denounced the Affordable Care Act for failing to cover enough people; they made \u201cskin in the game,\u201d i.e., high out-of-pocket costs, the centerpiece of their health care ideology, then denounced the act for high deductibles. When they finally got their chance at repeal, the contrast between what they had promised and their actual proposals produced widespread and justified public revulsion.\n\nBut the stark dishonesty of the Republican jihad against Obamacare itself demands an explanation. For it went well beyond normal political spin: for seven years a whole party kept insisting that black was white and up was down.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd that kind of behavior doesn\u2019t come out of nowhere. The Republican health care debacle was the culmination of a process of intellectual and moral deterioration that began four decades ago, at the very dawn of modern movement conservatism \u2014 that is, during the very era anti-Trump conservatives now point to as the golden age of conservative thought.",

Calhoun\u2019s name from a residential college.\n\nMr. Witt called Mr. Trump\u2019s warning of a slippery slope a \u201cred herring.\u201d There have been, after all, no calls to tear down the Washington Monument.\n\nAnnette Gordon-Reed, a professor of history and law at Harvard who is credited with breaking down the wall of resistance among historians to the idea that Jefferson had a sexual relationship with Sally Hemings, said that the answer to Mr. Trump\u2019s hypothetical question about whether getting rid of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson also meant junking Washington and Jefferson was a simple \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThere is a crucial difference between leaders like Washington and Jefferson, imperfect men who helped create the United States, Ms. Gordon-Reed said, and Confederate generals like Jackson and Lee, whose main historical significance is that they took up arms against it. The comparison, she added, also \u201cmisapprehends the moral problem with the Confederacy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis is not about the personality of an individual and his or her flaws,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about men who organized a system of government to maintain a system of slavery and to destroy the American union.\u201d\n\nAs for the idea of erasing history, it\u2019s a possibility most scholars do not take lightly.

Mr. Grossman noted that most Confederate monuments were constructed in two periods: the 1890s, as Jim Crow was being established, and in the 1950s, during a period of mass Southern resistance to the civil rights movement.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe would not want to whitewash our history by pretending that Jim Crow and disenfranchisement or massive resistance to the civil rights movement never happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the part of our history that these monuments testify to.\u201d\n\nHow the events in Charlottesville, and Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, will affect the continuing debate over Confederate monuments remains to be seen. Mr. Witt, for one, suggested that white nationalist support might backfire.\n\nHe noted that it was the 2015 murder of nine African-American churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., by a white supremacist that led to the removal of the Confederate flag from statehouse grounds.\n\n\u201cThe amazing thing is that the president is doing more to endanger historical monuments than most of the protesters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe alt-right is producing a world where there is more pressure to remove monuments, rather than less.\u201d",

Tierney, a former Maine attorney general who helped pull the joint statement together. \u201cHe said it clearly at great political risk, and maybe personal risk to himself at the time.\u201d\n\nThe signatories represent both major parties and 36 of the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Mr. Baxley, 76, who called the statement \u201cone of the most touching gestures that anybody\u2019s ever made on my behalf,\u201d said that was the most meaningful part.\n\n\u201cWhen you look down that list, there\u2019s many fine Republicans as well as Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the way it ought to be on issues like this, condemning sheer hatred.\u201d\n\nThough the decision not to address the statement to anyone in particular was deliberate \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to lobby anybody,\u201d Mr. Tierney said \u2014 the context is clear. It has been less than two weeks since a man drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters at a rally of white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Va., and one week since Mr. Trump doubled down on his assertion that \u201cboth sides\u201d were responsible. Much of the national conversation since then has focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to do exactly what the statement urges: unequivocally condemn hate and those who espouse it.\n\n\u201cI had no absolutely no patience for them, or for public officials that didn\u2019t stand up to them,\u201d Mr. Baxley said of the K.K.K. A majority of Southerners also opposed the K.K.K. in the 1970s, he recalled, \u201cbut yet they didn\u2019t speak up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Baxley, who now works at a law firm in Alabama, was not involved in writing Monday\u2019s statement but said he agreed with its message.\n\n\u201cAnybody that espouses that rhetoric and that doctrine is not just expressing a difference of opinion \u2014 they\u2019re advocating the most horrific acts that you can imagine towards innocent people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just cannot be tolerated in a just society, or else you get something like you had in Nazi Germany. You just can\u2019t allow that to take root.\u201d\n\nMr. Tierney, now a lecturer at Harvard Law School, emphasized in an interview that Mr. Baxley\u2019s stance had been politically risky for an Alabama official in the 1970s. And that, he said, was the example he and the other former attorneys general wanted to remind people of.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re politicians; we do what we have to do to get elected, but, you know, we draw the line. And Bill drew the line,\u201d Mr. Tierney said. \u201cWe wanted to give his courageous act voice at a time when the country needs to hear that there are courageous voices.\u201d",

        "text": "Photo\n\nLONDON \u2014 In his first solo trip to the broader Middle East as President Trump\u2019s designated peacemaker, Jared Kushner has found both cause for optimism and reminders of just what a daunting task his father-in-law has given him.\n\nOver the course of two days, he met with leaders from several influential Arab countries and emerged encouraged by their stated eagerness to help him bring Israelis and Palestinians together. But his visit on Wednesday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt showed how other issues can easily complicate the initiative as both sides sought to paper over a dispute over American aid.\n\nJust a day earlier, the United States cut or delayed nearly $300 million in aid to Egypt, a symbolic blow to a strategic relationship that has been a pillar of American policy in the Middle East for almost four decades. It was also a sign of growing impatience on the part of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who does not share Mr. Trump\u2019s affinity for Mr. Sisi.\n\nMr. Kushner was caught out by bad timing \u2014 his trip to Egypt had been fixed weeks earlier and officials said the aid decision was driven by schedules unrelated to his travels. Mr. Sisi and Mr. Kushner gave no public hint of discord as they grinned and shook hands for the benefit of news photographers; Mr. Sisi\u2019s office later issued a lengthy statement praising relations between the two nations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tillerson tightened the purse strings to signal displeasure with Mr. Sisi for several reasons. One was a harsh law enacted by Mr. Sisi in May making it virtually impossible for some nongovernmental organizations to operate freely in Egypt. The other was Egypt\u2019s close relationship with North Korea, which stretches back to the 1970s but has become a serious irritant amid the recent surge in tensions between Washington and Pyongyang.",

The dollar has declined as other economies, especially those in Europe, have been showing signs of life, even as expectations for the American economy have cooled this year.\n\nJust a few months ago, economists were expecting a strong rebound for the second quarter, with the consensus in May calling for 3.7 percent growth.

The final number could be revised higher or lower, depending on factors like consumer spending, business investment, factory orders and imports and exports.\n\nThe White House has said that its long-term target for growth is 4 percent, and Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the economy could grow faster if regulations were rolled back and trade policies were toughened to encourage American companies to manufacture more of their products in the United States.\n\nBut many economists say that goal is unrealistic, given fundamental factors like an aging population and the retirement of the baby boomers, along with years of slow productivity gains.\n\nThe last time annual economic growth topped 4 percent was in 2000, at the end of the tech-fueled boom of the late-1990s. Since then, the American economy\u2019s best annual performance was in 2005, just before the bursting of the housing bubble, when annual growth was 3.3 percent.\n\n\u201cWe could grow slightly faster than we are now, if you had comprehensive tax reform and a 10-year infrastructure spending program,\u201d Mr. Gapen said. \u201cThat could get us to 2.5 percent growth per year or slightly better. But 4 percent is highly unlikely.\u201d",

As the legislation sat, the administration lobbied against it, finding common cause with oil and gas companies, defense contractors and other financial players who argued that some of the sanctions provisions could harm their profits.\n\nThe House version included a handful of changes from the initial Senate bill, some made in response to concerns raised by American energy companies. Those tweaks, combined with the addition of sanctions against North Korea that were drafted by the House, helped end the impasse.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House approved the measure, 419 to 3.\n\nNow, as ever, attention turns to the president.\n\nSenator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he \u201ccannot imagine\u201d Mr. Trump rejecting legislation with such veto-proof majorities in Congress.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But conservative lawmakers have found themselves at odds with their own president amid Mr. Trump\u2019s stated desire to find common ground with Russia, against the background of Russia-tinged scandals that have consumed his administration.\n\nSenator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has long advocated an aggressive stance toward Russia, cheered colleagues for summoning bipartisanship \u201cto respond to Russia\u2019s attack on American democracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe will not tolerate attacks on our democracy. That\u2019s what this bill is all about,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cWe must take our own side in this fight, not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Americans.\u201d\n\nDemocrats took more explicit aim at Mr. Trump, suggesting that the legislation reflected a dim view of his credibility on Russia.\n\n\u201cThis bill will prevent President Trump from relaxing sanctions on Russia without congressional review,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who urged Mr. Trump to sign the legislation as quickly as possible. \u201cWe\u2019re all concerned about that.\u201d\n\nSenator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, called on Republican leaders in Congress to publicly commit to overriding any veto, in the hopes of deterring Mr. Trump before he tries. And Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said that \u201cit won\u2019t matter what President Trump decides\u201d given Congress\u2019s overwhelming support for the sanctions.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s perspective on the matter is clear.\n\nSeveral days ago, as details of the final sanctions agreement came into focus, Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, was asked by the government-run news agency RIA to characterize Moscow\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cHighly negative,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "Mr. Rosenstein added, \u201cNobody is directing us and nobody is going to direct us about which cases to pursue.\u201d\n\nBut even if developing headlines are not rippling through the department in real time \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve made a point of telling my people they should not be monitoring the breaking news,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said \u2014 the attacks by Mr. Trump, including his firing of the acting attorney general and the F.B.I. director, as well as calls to investigate a political opponent, have reverberated loudly. All the same, Mr. Sessions is carrying out the president\u2019s conservative agenda with head-turning speed, roiling critics on the left and leaving some career staff members within the department disoriented by the sea change.\n\n\u201cSessions as attorney general has been everything conservatives could have dreamed of and liberals could have feared,\u201d said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn the last six months, the attorney general has rolled back Obama-era policies on gay rights, voting rights, and criminal justice and police reform while advancing his own fight against drugs, gangs and violent crime. The scope of the work goes far beyond the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in last year\u2019s election and possible ties to the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cIf you just read the media stories, you get a very narrow view of what the Department of Justice is doing,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way I see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Sessions has mandated that prosecutors be as tough as possible in charging and sentencing all crimes, including drug offenses that carry stiff mandatory minimum prison sentences. He has expanded the ability of the police to seize people\u2019s assets, irrespective of whether they may have been convicted of a crime or even charged. And as he presses a hard-line immigration agenda, he has dispatched additional federal prosecutors to border districts to prosecute immigration cases and has ordered cities and states to fall in line with federal immigration authorities or else face cuts in federal funding.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Sessions attached new conditions to local partnerships focused on reducing crime, requiring so-called sanctuary cities like Baltimore to honor federal requests to detain people suspected of being undocumented immigrants if they wanted to participate. On Friday, Mr. Sessions is expected to announce several investigations into leaking, a priority for the president, who has denounced the stream of information out of his administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s most loyal constituencies praise Mr. Sessions as the cabinet member most effectively delivering on the president\u2019s promises. \u201cWe\u2019re heartened by his no-nonsense approach to criminal justice,\u201d said James O. Pasco Jr., the former executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police and now a senior adviser to that organization\u2019s president. \u201cHe\u2019s using the bully pulpit to show his support for law enforcement and make cities safer.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough it will take time for the full effects of the new policies to be seen, legal experts said, changes have already taken root.\n\nBrett Tolman, a former United States attorney in Utah during the administration of George W. Bush, said Mr. Sessions\u2019s policies on criminal charging and sentencing had already drastically affected some of his clients in federal cases not just limited to drugs. In conversations with assistant United States attorneys around the country, Mr. Tolman said, the prosecutors cited Mr. Sessions\u2019s directives in refusing to negotiate in situations they previously would have.\n\n\u201cThere is a definite difference in the mentality of the Department of Justice, and you see it already,\u201d said Mr. Tolman, who previously worked as counsel to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. Mr. Tolman praised past bipartisan progress on criminal justice reform and said Mr. Sessions was out of step: \u201cThis is the 1980s and \u201990s mentality, and an absolute 180-degree reversal from what we\u2019ve learned.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMr. Sessions has not loudly promoted the changes. In travels around the country, he has rarely spoken with the press as public attention has centered on the government\u2019s Russia inquiry. Mr. Sessions recused himself from the investigation in March after his own undisclosed meetings with the Russian ambassador became public. He left in charge Mr. Rosenstein, who in turn appointed Mr. Mueller, a former F.B.I. director, as special counsel.\n\nMr. Sessions\u2019s recusal has gnawed at the president, who has said he would have chosen a different attorney general had he known Mr. Sessions would step away from the inquiry \u2014 something Mr. Sessions did in keeping with the guidance of the Justice Department\u2019s ethics lawyers. Mr. Trump, who considered Mr. Sessions a loyalist, has called the recusal \u201cunfair to the president\u201d and chastised Mr. Rosenstein for appointing Mr. Mueller.\n\nEven as Mr. Trump\u2019s new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, assured Mr. Sessions this week that he was not at risk of being fired, Mr. Trump has issued no such reassurance.\n\nBeyond personal attacks, the president has taken broader swipes at the department for how it has defended his travel ban, which aimed to close the nation\u2019s borders to travelers from certain predominantly Muslim countries. He has also called for criminal inquiries into Hillary Clinton while calling the Russia investigation a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nThe tension between the Justice Department\u2019s leadership and the president, however, has made some career prosecutors and senior officials \u2014 including supporters of the administration\u2019s agenda \u2014 uneasy, according to more than two dozen current and former Justice Department officials.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince May, Mr. Rosenstein has addressed an array of Justice Department staff members, from the public integrity section in Washington to field offices of federal prosecutors in Nevada and South Carolina, seeking to deliver a simple message: Business as usual.\n\nAs the Justice Department operates with only a handful of officials confirmed by the Senate \u2014 including Mr. Sessions, Mr. Rosenstein and Christopher A. Wray, the new F.B.I. director \u2014 the administration has sought to put in place other permanent leadership. Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Sessions have spent some Saturdays this summer meeting with United States attorney candidates to recommend to the president to replace the 46 United States attorneys Mr. Trump forced out this spring. As of Friday, the administration had made 32 nominations, which Mr. Rosenstein cited as \u201can illustration that we\u2019re moving fairly quickly.\u201d\n\nOthers say the vacancies have certain divisions on autopilot. Prosecutors are less likely to take risks or act with a broader sense of strategy, said Kerry B. Harvey, a former United States attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky during the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a long period of time where you don\u2019t have presidential appointees, the day-to-day work gets done but it tends to be somewhat directionless,\u201d Mr. Harvey said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s ironic the president\u2019s comments seem to be calculated to weaken the Department of Justice\u2019s ability to implement his agenda.\u201d\n\nBut as the department presses on with the administration\u2019s agenda, its officials have not wholly turned a blind eye to their place in protecting established government norms.\n\nAmong the paintings that Mr. Rosenstein selected to decorate his conference room at the Justice Department is a portrait of Edward H. Levi, appointed attorney general by President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 after the department\u2019s credibility had been eroded by President Richard M. Nixon, whose firing of the Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, led to the resignations of Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus in what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre in October 1973.\n\n\u201cThat right there,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said, motioning to the portrait of Mr. Levi. \u201cThat\u2019s the post-Watergate A.G.\u201d",

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said in 1965.\n\nBut in preaching his message, Garvey unintentionally spawned a religion when he said: \u201cLook to Africa, when a black king shall be crowned, for the day of deliverance is near.\u201d\n\nIn 1930, Ras Tafari Makonnen \u2014 known thereafter as Haile Selassie \u2014 ascended to Ethiopia\u2019s throne, which was taken as a fulfillment of Garvey\u2019s words. Rastafarians immediately hailed Selassie as Jah, the Black Messiah.\n\nGarvey was not a follower himself, but Rastafari spread across the globe several decades later with the help of reggae musicians, most prominently Bob Marley.\n\nSelassie died in 1975, but Rastafarians remained convinced he was the living God.

The growing threat from the North has bolstered his drive to strengthen Japan\u2019s military, which has long been constrained by the country\u2019s war-renouncing Constitution.\n\nBecause of that, the latest escalation of tensions might seem to play into Mr. Abe\u2019s hands.\n\nOn Thursday, North Korea said it was drawing up plans to launch intermediate-range ballistic missiles into waters near Guam, an American territory that is home to an important Air Force base in the Pacific. The missiles, it said, would fly over western Japan \u2014 reviving memories of a North Korean missile that flew over northern Japan in 1998, causing a national uproar.\n\nA Moody Young Man With a Nuclear Arsenal\n\n\u201cThe D.P.R.K. has already acquired the capabilities of reducing the Japanese archipelago to ashes in a second once it makes up its mind,\u201d the North\u2019s state news agency said an a statement accompanying the Guam plan, using the initials for the country\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJapan is already moving to strengthen its antimissile defenses, and officials are debating whether to acquire weapons like long-range cruise missiles that would allow the country to strike targets in North Korea, either in retaliation or pre-emptively if it concluded that an attack by the North was imminent.\n\nDeploying such weapons would break with decades of precedent, and the idea is contentious. In keeping with the pacifist Constitution, Japan\u2019s military is meant to protect the country from direct attack, while its partner the United States handles offensive duties like striking enemy bases \u2014 a so-called shield and spear arrangement.\n\nMost Japanese appear happy with that division of labor, despite concerns about North Korea, and Mr. Abe needs to tread carefully if he hopes to change it.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s approval ratings have tumbled in recent months, specialists say, in part because voters believe he is overreaching in his efforts to roll back restrictions on the military, including with controversial proposed changes to the Constitution. Polls show that only about a third of voters support such constitutional changes.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAbe will want to spend his dwindling political capital on his long-held goal of constitutional revision,\u201d James L. Schoff, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in an article posted on Thursday.\n\nA \u201cbold move\u201d to acquire offensive weapons, he added, \u201cwould undermine this effort.\u201d\n\nMr. Abe faces a leadership contest in the governing Liberal Democratic Party next year. His main rival, Fumio Kishida, a former foreign minister, appears to be betting that the public favors a more cautious approach to transforming the military.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One might even call him a hawk,\u201d Mr. Kishida said Thursday on a television debate program, adding, \u201cI\u2019m a liberal, a dove.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s combative language on North Korea makes matters trickier for Mr. Abe. The president has doubled down on his war of words with Mr. Kim\u2019s government, saying a previous threat to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on the North might not have been tough enough.\n\nIn Japan, such comments have served as a reminder of the risks involved in confronting the North militarily. Despite the North\u2019s recent development of ballistic missiles that experts say could reach the United States, North Korea\u2019s neighbors would probably bear the brunt of its attacks. For that reason, support for military action against the North is low in both South Korea and Japan \u2014 a fact that Mr. Trump\u2019s statements are hardly helping to change.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s growing concern,\u201d said Hideshi Takesada, a specialist on defense issues at the Institute of World Studies at Takushoku University, \u201cabout whether the U.S. is really thinking about the security of Japan and South Korea.\u201d",

Delays in passing health care legislation laid bare the deep divisions within the Republican Party and suggested that sweeping changes to tax laws \u2014 which are generally considered even more complicated than health care policy \u2014 could take even longer and drag into next year.\n\nRepublicans in Congress must also finish or abandon their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, raise the debt ceiling and pass a budget resolution before they can expect to fully dig in to a tax bill.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Armies of lobbyists have been trawling Washington, preparing to fight for and against various provisions. The taxation of small businesses, deductions for corporate interest expenses and the state and local tax deduction are expected to lead to the biggest battles. And no guidance was offered on these fronts on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ryan and Mr. Brady were both dismissive of Mr. Trump\u2019s recent suggestion that perhaps the rich should see their tax rates increase to offer more relief to the middle class.\n\nTo avoid getting bogged down, some Republicans have said that the party should simply push through short-term tax cuts, even if they would add to deficits and expire in 10 years. So far, however, Republican leaders remain committed to a deficit-neutral tax plan that would not reduce tax revenue.\n\nWall Street and business groups have grown increasingly impatient that the centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda is stalling. The statement of progress was welcomed as a sign of hope that something might get done.\n\n\u201cThe engagement and enthusiasm for pro-growth tax reform from Trump administration officials and congressional lawmakers is what will propel this over the finish line,\u201d said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe demise of the border tax, which would have taxed imports and let exports go untaxed, also came as a relief to retailers, who have said for months that it would cripple an industry. On Thursday, they cheered the development.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important win for retailers and American families,\u201d said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. \u201cIt allows us to pivot to working with lawmakers to getting tax reform done.\u201d\n\nAmerican exporters expressed hope that they would still benefit from a tax overhaul. \u201cFrom the beginning, we have pushed for significantly lower corporate tax rates, permanent reforms that give businesses the certainty they need to invest here in the U.S., and a territorial tax system that levels the playing field for American companies competing abroad,\u201d said Ken Spain, a spokesman for the American Made Coalition.\n\nDemocrats scoffed at the latest Republican outline as another vague set of ideas that would benefit the rich. \u201cRepublicans are dripping tax ideas out like a leaky faucet with no specifics to back them up,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. He urged Republicans to work with his party in a bipartisan manner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite claims that they are open to working with Democrats, it was clear on Thursday that such overtures from Republicans were halfhearted.\n\nMr. Brady said that lawmakers from the House and Senate tax-writing committees would convene next month at the Ronald Reagan Ranch in California, where they would contemplate the tax code and seek inspiration to conquer the big legislative task that awaits. Mr. Brady plans to give a speech at the event, which is still in the planning stages.\n\nAsked if Democrats would be coming along, Mr. Brady did not hesitate.\n\n\"No,\u201d he said.",

They knew what bait to use and had a plan to reel in the fish once it bit.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know for sure whether the email solicitation was part of an intelligence ploy, there are some clues. A month after the June meeting at Trump Tower, WikiLeaks, a veritable Russian front, released a dump of stolen D.N.C. emails. The candidate and campaign surrogates increasingly mouthed talking points that seemed taken directly from Russian propaganda outlets, such as that there had been a terrorist attack on a Turkish military base, when no such attack had occurred. Also, at this time United States intelligence reportedly received indications from European intelligence counterparts about odd meetings between Russians and Trump campaign representatives overseas.\n\nOf course, to determine whether collusion occurred, we would have to know whether the Trump campaign continued to meet with Russian representatives subsequent to the June meeting. The early \u201ccourting\u201d stage is almost always somewhat open and discoverable. Only after the Russian intelligence officer develops a level of control can the relationship be moved out of the public eye. John Brennan, the former director of the C.I.A., recently testified, \u201cFrequently, people who go along a treasonous path do not know they are on a treasonous path until it is too late.\u201d\n\nEven intelligence professionals who respect one another and who understand the Russians can and often do disagree. On the Trump collusion question, the difference of opinion comes down to this: Would the Russians use someone like Mr. Goldstone to approach the Trump campaign? Our friend and former colleague Daniel Hoffman argued in this paper that this is unlikely \u2014 that the Russians would have relied on trained agents. We respectfully disagree. We believe that the Russians might well have used Mr. Goldstone. We also believe the Russians would have seen very little downside to trying to recruit someone on the Trump team \u2014 a big fish. If the fish bit and they were able to reel it in, the email from Mr. Goldstone could remain hidden and, since it was from an acquaintance, would be deniable if found. (Exactly what the Trump team is doing now.)\n\nIf the fish didn\u2019t take the bait, the Russians would always have had the option to weaponize the information later to embarrass the Trump team. In addition, if the Russians\u2019 first objective was chaos and disruption, the best way to accomplish that would have been to have someone on the inside helping. It is unlikely that the Russians would not use all the traditional espionage tools available to them.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most telling piece of information may be the most obvious. Donald Trump himself made numerous statements in support of Russia, Russian intelligence and WikiLeaks during the campaign. At the same time, Mr. Trump and his team have gone out of their way to hide contacts with Russians and lied to the public about it. Likewise, Mr. Trump has attacked those people and institutions that could get to the bottom of the affair. He fired his F.B.I. director James Comey, criticized and bullied his attorney general and deputy attorney general, denigrated the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., and assails the news media, labeling anything he dislikes \u201cfake news.\u201d Innocent people don\u2019t tend to behave this way.\n\nThe overall Russian intent is clear: disruption of the United States political system and society, a goal that in the Russian view was best served by a Trump presidency. What remains to be determined is whether the Russians also attempted to suborn members of the Trump team in an effort to gain their cooperation. This is why the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, is so important. It is why the F.B.I. counterintelligence investigation, also quietly progressing in the background, is critical. Because while a Russian disruption operation is certainly plausible, it is not inconsistent with a much darker Russian goal: gaining an insider ally at the highest levels of the United States government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn short, and regrettably, collusion is not off the table.",

        "text": "Photo\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nSusan E. Rice is correct about the longstanding \u201cbelligerent and colorful rhetoric\u201d of North Korea (\u201cIt\u2019s Not Too Late on North Korea,\u201d Op-Ed, Aug. 10). But missing is a sense of why North Korea became this way in the first place.\n\nNorth Korean leaders developed their paranoid worldview in the wake of the devastation of the Korean War, when the United States carpet-bombed the North, using more bombs than in the Pacific theater of World War II. Its leaders subsequently developed a bunker mentality, vowing never again to be such a target. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the North Koreans developed nuclear weapons to ensure their country\u2019s survival. This strategy has worked so far.\n\nOne can condemn the regime and still try to understand its perspective in order to engage in meaningful diplomacy. The stakes are too high.\n\nMARNIE ANDERSON\n\nNORTHAMPTON, MASS.\n\nThe writer is an associate professor of history at Smith College.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI disagree with two statements in Susan E. Rice\u2019s otherwise excellent analysis of the situation in North Korea. First she says, \u201cBy most assessments, Mr. Kim is vicious and impetuous, but not irrational.\u201d Kim Jong-un is paranoid and for little reason; no one wants to invade the North, for there is nothing to gain. The economy is in shambles, poverty reigns, the people live in fear, and they produce nothing of value save some natural resources.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer second point with which I take exception is: \u201cHistory shows that we can, if we must, tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea \u2014 the same way we tolerated the far greater threat of thousands of Soviet nuclear weapons during the Cold War.\u201d At that time both the United States and the Soviet Union had leaders in charge who knew from experience the horrors of both conventional and nuclear war. I strongly believe that knowledge, above all, acted as a pause button in both countries. I do not believe that Mr. Kim has such self-control. I think he just wants to blow something up.",

North Korean pilots trained Egyptian fighter pilots before the 1973 war with Israel, and Egypt was later accused of supplying Scud missiles to North Korea, said Daniel Leone of the Project on Middle East Democracy.\n\nThis year, United Nations investigators said they acquired evidence of North Korean trade in \u201chitherto unreported items such as encrypted military communications, man-portable air defense systems, air defense systems and satellite-guided missiles\u201d in the Middle East and Africa, among other locations.\n\nIn 2015, a United Nations panel said that Egypt\u2019s Port Said was being used by North Korean front companies and shipping agents engaged in weapons smuggling.\n\nSuccessive American administrations have privately raised the issue of North Korea in talks with Cairo, but with little success. The United States may be pressuring Egypt over its civilian and military links to North Korea. One of Egypt\u2019s richest men, Naguib Sawiris, owns Orascom Telecom Media and Technology, the telecommunications company that helped set up North Korea\u2019s main cellular telephone network in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother factor in the decision to limit funding to Egypt is the draconian law regulating aid agencies \u2014 particularly those funded by Western governments and organizations \u2014 which was signed into law by Mr. Sisi in late May. Several Egyptian groups, including those working with victims of police torture, said the law will make it impossible for them to continue their work and may force them to shut down.\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed significant cutbacks in foreign aid and has promised to demand greater accountability from aid recipients.\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s actions were not as tough as they might have been. By pausing the provision of $195 million in military funding, the Trump administration saved the money from expiring entirely on Sept. 30. This way, Egypt could eventually get the money if its record on human rights improves.",

The administration announced sanctions on July 18 related to Iran\u2019s development and testing of missiles, along with its support for Syria\u2019s government and software theft.

        "text": "Photo\n\nYou\u2019re a former Republican communications strategist who worked for George W. Bush, John McCain and Sarah Palin, and now you have a show on MSNBC. What\u2019s it like on that side of the table? I was always the \u2018\u2018squishy\u2019\u2019 one on the Bush White House staff. No one I worked for was ever deceived by my degrees of conservative principles, and that was my value to them: I understood the other side. I helped most of the people I worked for soften their polarizing edges. But to say that I would be totally unemployable in today\u2019s political climate is probably an understatement. That\u2019s just not what any of them do.\n\nWhat do you think it\u2019s like working at the White House right now? There\u2019s a pretty high level of alarm based on how easy it is to get people to talk about what\u2019s actually happening inside the White House, and you never know the whole story. As chaotic and dysfunctional as it looks from the outside, from my experience with Sarah Palin, I know what\u2019s known and discussed publicly is usually just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nDo you think we still know only the tip of the iceberg with Palin? Well, what I think was unknown was the degree of her rejection of us asking her to do anything that wasn\u2019t her own idea. We were dealing with someone who was maybe ahead of her time. Her irreverence and disdain for the establishment of her own party and her embrace of the \u2018\u2018isms\u2019\u2019 \u2014 nativism, isolationism, you know \u2014 she blew the walls out on the political norms before Donald Trump did. She was obviously onto something. She had crowds five times the size of McCain\u2019s. We think it was all about her political skills, but it was also about her message. She railed against the mainstream media, she attacked all of us, her own advisers. That her audiences were so enthusiastic about that was the early signal that the party had changed.\n\nWallace is the host of \u2018\u2018Deadline: White House\u2019\u2019 on MSNBC and a contributor to the \u2018\u2018Today\u2019\u2019 show. She was a White House communications director under George W. Bush. Age: 45 Occupation: Political analyst and television anchor Hometown: Orinda, Calif. Her Top 5 Political Movies: 1. \u2018\u2018Dave\u2019\u2019 (1993) 2. \u2018\u2018The American President\u2019\u2019 (1995) 3. \u2018\u2018Bulworth\u2019\u2019 (1998) 4. \u2018\u2018Primary Colors\u2019\u2019 (1998) 5. \u2018\u2018All the President's Men\u2019\u2019 (1976)\n\nMany people think that, because of Trump\u2019s volatility, we\u2019re experiencing potentially unpredecented political destabilization. How do you think this administration stacks up to the Bush White House? Before 9/11, Bush spent the first seven or eight months of his presidency trying to work in a bipartisan manner. He passed the education bill with Ted Kennedy\u2019s support; he passed the tax cut with Max Baucus\u2019s support. I mean, he had some relationships on the other side, and then, obviously, the attack brought everyone together \u2014 probably for too brief a time. Trump went on Twitter and attacked a Republican, his sitting attorney general and the acting director of F.B.I. \u2014 all before 11 a.m. today. If something happened in the national security realm, he\u2019d need them to assist him in protecting the country. It\u2019s almost like that part of the job hasn\u2019t been explained to him. He\u2019s just there trying to do what he thinks the \u2018\u2018president\u2019\u2019 part is.\n\nDo you have any advice for people who have to work for President Trump? They have to have their own \u2018\u2018red line\u2019\u2019 and live by it. Maybe it\u2019s attacking a morning anchor for her plastic surgery. I don\u2019t know what it is; it\u2019s way beyond what I would stay and tolerate. Everyone needs to have a limit, then keep their head down and try to do their job until and unless that limit is reached. Only Donald Trump\u2019s White House could make the Bush years look like the golden age of presidential history.\n\nWhat do you think you\u2019d be covering if you didn\u2019t cover Trump? One of the symptoms of the time of Trump is that there\u2019s no other news. I sometimes think: If there were another Arab Spring, how would we cover it? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s an impossible question to test because you can\u2019t remove Trump and see what we would do without him, but it\u2019s an interesting question.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about how your parents voted for Trump. Have they changed their views of him? We don\u2019t talk about politics anymore.",

        "text": "Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Mr. Putin as a strong leader who has done good things for Russia. Challenged once by a Fox News interviewer about whether Mr. Putin was actually a killer, given the repeated slayings of opposition leaders and independent journalists in Russia, Mr. Trump defended the Kremlin leader by saying, \u201cThere are a lot of killers. You think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d\n\nMr. Putin\u2019s decision to slash the embassy staff recalled some of the most antagonistic moments of the long Cold War and was Russia\u2019s largest such move against the American diplomatic corps in decades.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAs of 2013, the latest year that numbers are publicly available, 1,279 people worked at the United States Embassy in Moscow and at American consulates in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok. The vast majority of those who will lose their jobs are Russian nationals, not American diplomats, who will be brought home. Assuming the current force is about the same, Mr. Putin\u2019s order will require a nearly 60 percent reduction.\n\nMr. Putin said he was reducing the American government\u2019s overall presence to the equivalent of the Russian presence in the United States. But the total staff includes more than just State Department diplomats; other American government agencies have employees stationed in Russia, including the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce, NASA and the Library of Congress.\n\nAmerican officials said the reduction ordered by Mr. Putin will have a significant effect on services, resulting, for example, in much slower processing of visas for Russian travelers to the United States. Another major function of any embassy is to collect local information and intelligence to inform policy makers back home, which will likely be hindered as a result.\n\n\u201cCutting our staff by 755 people will do tremendous damage to our diplomatic mission in Russia,\u201d said Michael A. McFaul, who was ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama. \u201cThat our president does not appreciate this obvious fact suggests he doesn\u2019t understand what embassies do in the pursuit of American national interests.\u201d\n\nMr. Putin\u2019s order was a delayed reaction to Mr. Obama\u2019s seizing of two Russian diplomatic properties in the United States last year. The Obama administration also expelled 35 Russian diplomats after American intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the embassy staff reduction was triggered by legislation \u2014 approved last month by near-unanimous bipartisan votes in both houses of Congress \u2014 mandating sanctions against Russia and curtailing Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to lift them without a review by lawmakers. Mr. Putin, who like Mr. Trump has generally avoided direct criticism of his American counterpart, acted before the president signed the bill so that it would be a response to Congress rather than Mr. Trump.\n\nWith any veto certain to be overridden, Mr. Trump reluctantly signed the sanctions legislation. But he attached a signing statement to it, making clear that he considered some of the law\u2019s provisions unconstitutional and leaving open the possibility that he might not abide by them as Congress intended.\n\nBecause the staff reductions are not required to take place until Sept. 1, some analysts noted the possibility that Mr. Putin was leaving room for a compromise to avert them from happening. But Mr. Trump expressed no concern about the embassy cuts, suggesting there would be no effort to try to reverse or mitigate the Russian decision.\n\nRepresentative Kathleen Rice, Democrat of New York, chastised Mr. Trump for his comments. \u201cThis is insulting to US diplomats,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cAlso, really, really stupid. Diplomats don\u2019t get fired for getting kicked out of a hostile foreign country.\u201d",

Bannon, who was recently removed as a top Trump adviser, fought the military\u2019s recommendation for more troops and backed a number of alternative options \u2014 including using private contractors instead of United States forces.\n\nThe decision on troops is just one component of a military and political plan for the region that Mr. Trump and his aides have been discussing for months, and it is politically important for the president to differentiate his approach from the Obama-era policies he sharply criticized.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Funding for Pakistan, including contributions for Pakistani troops deployed near the border with Afghanistan, may be held up to more scrutiny than it is now, according to Pentagon and congressional officials.\n\nTrump administration officials have also worked to lock in troop commitments from NATO and other Western nations, an important consideration for a president who has demanded that allies shoulder part of the burden.\n\nTrump administration officials say they know they will need to reassure the American public that American military involvement in the long conflict will not be open-ended and will help combat international terrorism.\n\nMoreover, many officials believe they need to do so without setting firm deadlines for reducing or withdrawing American troops, a practice President Obama embraced but which Trump officials assert denied the military needed flexibility and played into the hands of the United States\u2019 adversaries.\n\nOne way to address that concern, administration officials have said in recent weeks, might be to stipulate that the Afghans would need to satisfy certain conditions, like fighting corruption or improving governance, to continue to receive American economic and military support.\n\nVideo\n\nA number of high-level participants in the review have important experience on these issues, especially Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and Maj. Gen. Ricky Waddell, the deputy national security adviser. Each headed an anti-corruption task force in Afghanistan.\n\nFew people think that the war in Afghanistan can be ended anytime soon.\n\nGen. John W. Nicholson, commander of the American-led international force in Afghanistan, told Congress in February that the United States and its NATO allies were facing a \u201cstalemate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to a report to Congress by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, 57 percent of the districts in the country were under the Afghan government\u2019s control as of November 2016, a 15 percent decrease from the previous year.\n\nAn estimated 8,400 American troops are stationed in Afghanistan, most assigned to an approximately 13,000-strong international force that is training and advising the Afghan military. About 2,000 American troops are carry out counterterrorism missions along with Afghan forces against militant groups like the Islamic State\u2019s affiliate.\n\nSeveral hard-line lawmakers, including Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, had complained that Mr. Trump was delaying his decision as security in Afghanistan was eroding. Earlier this month, Senator McCain announced he had drafted an amendment outlining a new Afghan strategy because Mr. Trump had taken so long to act.\n\nAs recently as Monday, Mr. Mattis said that administration was weighing some radically different approaches, including withdrawing American forces and sending contractors to fight in Afghanistan rather than troops. The cost of deploying troops and contributions of allies were among the president\u2019s questions.\n\n\u201cThere were several options,\u201d Mr. Mattis said. \u201cThe reason we had to get back together was he kept asking questions on all of them.\u201d",

And he used his authority to declare an emergency in 2009 during the H1N1 influenza pandemic.\n\nWhite House and federal health officials did not respond to requests for more information about how Mr. Trump decided that an emergency declaration is necessary, despite the comments to the contrary from his advisers.\n\nDeclaring an emergency could allow states and cities that are hard hit by the opioid crisis to receive federal disaster relief funds and other types of urgent aid, just as they do after hurricanes or tornadoes through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nIt could also allow certain federal rules to be waived temporarily \u2014 for example, allowing Medicaid funds to be used for something they normally are not, or allowing access to experimental medications.\n\n\u201cIf you declare a state of emergency, you can move federal resources more easily between programmatic areas,\u201d said Michael Fraser, the executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. He added, however, that \u201cwhen it comes to opioids, it\u2019s really unclear\u201d what kind of effect a federal emergency declaration would have.\n\nSix states \u2014 Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts and Virginia \u2014 have already declared emergencies because of the opioid crisis. These declarations have helped expand access to naloxone, a medication that can revive people who have overdosed, according to the Network for Public Health Law. They have also helped states get federal grants for treatment services and improved reporting of overdoses.\n\nThe 21st Century Cures Act, which Congress approved last year, is already sending states $1 billion over two years for opioid addiction treatment and prevention, but experts say it is far short of what is needed. Ohio alone spent nearly $1 billion last year on addressing the opioid epidemic.",

Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, urged the United States to \u201ctake the first step away from the dangerous line.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, denounced North Korea, saying that Australia stands \u201cshoulder-to-shoulder with the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChina appeared to see an opening to present itself as the adult in the room and increase its regional influence. But even as the Trump administration pressed China to curb North Korea, Beijing raised another festering dispute on Friday, saying American naval operations in the South China Sea would only force it to deepen its military buildup there.\n\nSouth Korea told its people that the White House had agreed not to do anything on the Korean Peninsula that would catch the South off guard.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what happens if North Korean missiles do make it off the ground and head toward Guam.\n\nPeople who live on Guam, and the nearby Northern Mariana Islands, have talked about finding themselves suddenly in the cross hairs.\n\nOther consequences\n\nThe financial sector has been rattled, and stocks were driven down as investors sought havens.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s advisers are divided on how to proceed, and it is not clear what Mr. Kim will do, either.\n\nThe 33-year old North Korean ruler, once dismissed as a figurehead, is emerging as a powerful leader and a nuclear threat, traits that were highlighted in a Times video profile.\n\nStill, some supporters of Mr. Trump say he would be justified in launching a pre-emptive strike as an act of self-defense. Others say that, under international law, this would be deeply questionable.\n\nSign up for The Interpreter Newsletter to get sharp insight and commentary on the world and the major news stories of the week.",

We\u2019re going to do that.\u201d\n\nThe procedural vote in the Senate meant that the health care debate is just starting, and by the time he returned to Washington later in the evening senators had already rejected one plan to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s program and replace it with a Republican version. But Mr. Trump used the friendly Ohio setting to issue a warning to balky Republican senators.\n\n\u201cAny senator who votes against repeal-and-replace is telling America that they are fine with the Obamacare nightmare,\u201d he said, \u201cand I predict they\u2019ll have a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump returned to Ohio almost exactly a year after accepting the Republican nomination in this state. Ohio was one of the key battlegrounds that put him over the top in the Electoral College in November. But it is also the state run by one of his most vocal Republican critics, Gov. John Kasich, who stayed away on Tuesday.\n\nAccompanied and introduced by the first lady, Melania Trump, the president played to the crowd, talking about Ohio manufacturing and praising those who turned out as \u201ctrue American patriots.\u201d To make his case on trade, he cited a president from Ohio, William McKinley, although he then asked, \u201cDoes anybody know who the hell he is?\u201d\n\nBut for Mr. Trump, it was an affirming evening.\n\n\u201cBoy, oh boy, what people,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there any place that\u2019s more fun, more exciting and safer than a Trump rally?\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But that\u2019s not going to get it done.\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d he continued, \u201cI said, it\u2019s much easier to act presidential than what we\u2019re doing here tonight. And I said, with the exception of the late, great Abraham Lincoln, I can be more presidential than any president that\u2019s ever held this office. But sadly, we have to move a little faster than that.\u201d\n\nHe added a little later: \u201cI\u2019d ask whether you think someday I might be on Mount Rushmore, but here\u2019s the problem \u2014 if I did it, joking, totally joking, having fun, the fake news media will say, \u2018He believes he should be on Mount Rushmore.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Trump is on the road, he wanders off script at times. In West Virginia on Monday, he relished telling old stories, at one point regaling Boy Scouts in their teens and younger with a memory about a cocktail party that featured \u201cthe hottest people in New York.\u201d\n\nIn Youngstown, he mainly fell back on the highlight reel from last year\u2019s campaign, promising to keep \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d out of the United States, asserting that manufacturing jobs are \u201call coming back\u201d and promising the \u201csingle biggest tax cut in American history.\u201d\n\nHis incoming communications director said the other day that the strategy was to let Mr. Trump be Mr. Trump. And for the last few days, the president has returned to the road to do just that.\n\nIn other words, his message to Washington was clear: Deal with it.",

Shelby, who for years served alongside Mr. Sessions as his Republican colleague from Alabama, rallied to his defense on Twitter.\n\n\u201cJeff Sessions is a man of integrity, loyalty, and extraordinary character,\u201d Mr. Shelby said.\n\nPrivately, Senate Republicans were aghast at Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh treatment of the attorney general, saying they had never seen a similar Washington spectacle. They professed rising alarm that Mr. Trump would fire Mr. Sessions and seek the dismissal of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, decisions that several Republicans said they would consider disastrous. The offensive on behalf of Mr. Sessions seemed like an orchestrated effort to deter the president from shaking up the Justice Department.\n\nRepublicans also made clear that with Mr. Trump in the White House and their party in full control of Congress, they could not afford to miss the opportunity to undo the health care law. Given the years they have spent railing against it, they have more invested in the outcome than does the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have a duty to act,\u201d Mr. McConnell said as his solemn colleagues waited at their desks to vote on opening debate on repeal legislation. \u201cThe president is ready with his pen.\u201d\n\nConfronting one of the most serious leadership challenges of his career, Mr. McConnell used all the tools at his disposal \u2014 special benefits for some states, appeals to party loyalty, plain old arm-twisting \u2014 to win the vote by the narrowest margin possible.\n\nWith Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie and cries of \u201cshame, shame\u201d ringing in the chamber and the hallway from a prolonged protest, 50 Republican senators voted to roll the dice and move forward on an unusual debate whose final end was impossible to predict. But it was a victory for Mr. McConnell to even get this far after the effort to repeal the health law appeared dead multiple times and his legislative skills were being called into question.\n\nHe was aided by Mr. McCain, who flew to the capital just days after being diagnosed with brain cancer. Mr. McCain spoke eloquently of the importance of the Senate, its recent failures and his desire to see the institution return to its more traditional give-and-take between the parties. Yet he cast a decisive vote to move ahead with a legislative health care process that has been archly partisan, conducted by Republicans behind closed doors with no input from Democrats and a limited amount from the Republican rank and file.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we try the old way of legislating in the Senate, the way our rules and customs encourage us to act?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf this process ends in failure, which seems likely, then let\u2019s return to regular order.\u201d\n\nBut there is little that is regular about Washington these days as Republicans struggle to govern while keeping a wary eye on their partner in the White House.",

        "text": "Here are five reasons the danger may not be as scary as you\u2019ve heard.\n\nThe United States has been issuing vague threats against North Korea for more than 15 years.\n\nThe George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations both threatened war, setting red lines that Pyongyang almost always went on to cross. Mr. Bush even declared North Korea to be one third of the \u201caxis of evil,\u201d along with Iraq, which the United States military invaded the next year.\n\nNorth Korean leaders correctly assessed those threats as empty, never sending the countries careening into an unintended war. And the threats didn\u2019t seem to affect American credibility. It\u2019s not clear that Mr. Trump, by upgrading the adjectives in his own threats, changes much.\n\nAmericans might have strong views about what makes Mr. Trump different from his predecessors. But in Pyongyang, where the nuances of American politics and personalities are less familiar, those distinctions are likely less front-of-mind.\n\nWords matter in international relations, but actions matter far more.\n\nCurrent American action, or lack thereof, sends a message of calm and caution, rather than \u201cfire and fury.\u201d\n\nStates have a hard time reading one another\u2019s internal politics, so they tend to rely heavily on reading one another\u2019s actions for clues as to their intentions. And American action toward North Korea remains unchanged. American troops in nearby Guam and Japan are still in their barracks. Naval warships are holding a respectful distance.\n\nThese are the sorts of signals, not a leader\u2019s offhand comments, that matter most in international relations. Washington is sending a clear, consistent message to Pyongyang that the United States still wants to avoid escalation.\n\nVideo\n\nThough North Korea has returned Mr. Trump\u2019s threat with its own against Guam, the country\u2019s actions suggest it is only for show.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo one has an incentive to escalate, and all sides understand this.\n\nWars can happen when states conclude, rightly or wrongly, that the other side might see conflict is in its interests. This can lead them to prepare for war, making it likelier that an accident or miscalculation could send them stumbling into one. But that is not the case now.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s interests are to avoid a conflict it would likely lose. The United States\u2019 interests are to avoid a conflict that would risk a nuclear attack against an American city. That clarity is stabilizing.\n\nDespite longstanding speculation about Mr. Kim\u2019s mental fitness, scholars agree he has repeatedly proven himself rational and focused on his government\u2019s survival. His country\u2019s weapons programs are designed to deter a war, not start one. And while Mr. Trump\u2019s comment hint at an appetite for war, the institutions that carry out American foreign policy \u2014 particularly the military \u2014 have behaved conservatively, giving the world ample reason to dismiss his statement.\n\nStates tend to ignore unclear, isolated signals like Mr. Trump\u2019s.\n\nSome analysts worry that Mr. Trump could inject more uncertainty into an already tense situation.\n\nThe president\u2019s most bellicose statements appear to contradict his own administration\u2019s more measured lines on North Korea. But studies on foreign policy messaging suggest that Pyongyang will hear Mr. Trump\u2019s threats as empty.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

Overcoming that bias and forcing a state like North Korea to change its assessment of American intentions would require more than a few words.\n\nStates also tend to disregard any signal they perceive as unclear or ambiguous. If Americans can\u2019t agree on what Mr. Trump meant, you can bet the analysts in Pyongyang are no more certain.\n\nAny risk to American credibility or of trapping Mr. Trump in a dangerous position is easy to overstate.\n\nExtensive research suggests that empty threats neither damage a state\u2019s global credibility nor create pressures forcing it to follow through on those threats. Though questions of credibility are still debated by political scientists, history is littered with examples of false threats conveniently ignored.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev repeatedly threatened to seize West Berlin. But Soviet actions betrayed his threats as empty, allowing Washington and Moscow to quietly sidestep the risk of war in Germany. He never felt politically forced to invade. And few doubted Soviet credibility a few months later when Moscow tried to install nuclear weapons in Cuba \u2014 an action that spoke louder and more clearly than any of Khrushchev\u2019s words.\n\nThat is the real lesson of the Cuban missile crisis.\n\nIf Mr. Trump moves thousands of troops from Guam to South Korea, you can worry. That would send a clear and destabilizing signal of American intentions against North Korea. But one over-the-top quote is not worth losing sleep over.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf you want my advice, get off Twitter and go to dinner,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, wrote on Twitter as social media panic grew. \u201cThe nuclear war isn\u2019t tonight.\u201d",

        "text": "But Mr. Murdoch is not just any chief executive, and the company he runs, especially its cable news network, has enormous influence over the country\u2019s politics and media.\n\nRupert Murdoch, 86, who has long pursued power rather than a specific ideology, has served as an informal adviser to Mr. Trump and repeatedly urged him to fire Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist and nationalist who exited the White House on Friday.\n\nAt the same time, the Murdoch family controls both News Corporation, the owner of The Journal and The Post, as well as 21st Century Fox, home to a sprawling collection of movie studios and television networks. While there have been some cracks in the conservative wall, with the newspapers publishing more commentary critical of Mr. Trump, Fox News is known as Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred outlet.\n\nThat creates an uneasy balance for James Murdoch, 44, who is known to lean more toward the center than his father, but rarely expresses political views publicly. A fiscal conservative, James and his progressive-minded wife, Kathryn, have long advocated for the environment and expressed embarrassment by certain elements of Fox News, associates have said. Kathryn Murdoch has expressed contempt for Mr. Trump on her Twitter feed.\n\nThe response from other Twitter users is often critical.\n\n\u201cWell Kathryn it would help if your family\u2019s business #FoxNews wasn\u2019t a synchophantic state media arm of the Trump regime #WednesdayWisdom,\u201d one user said. \u201cSome in your orbit have potential to alter the media ecosystem within which his parasitic organism self thrives,\u201d said another.\n\nDespite all that, the Murdoch sons have said repeatedly that they didn\u2019t plan to significantly change the formula for Fox News, which fuels the company\u2019s business. Analysts estimate that the division generated 25 percent of 21st Century Fox\u2019s operating income last year, which was $6.6 billion.\n\n\u201cHe is trying to straddle a recognition that there are a lot of problems out there, and whether Fox News has contributed to them or not, the problems exist,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a media analyst with Pivotal Research. \u201cEven though James is technically the C.E.O., he\u2019s somewhere between can\u2019t and won\u2019t do anything that would cause changes to Fox News. This is a tricky divide.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

They introduced additional benefits, including more paid vacation, vastly enhanced reproductive coverage for women and \u201cexpanded coverage for our transgender colleagues.\u201d And in January, they spoke out about President Trump\u2019s travel ban, stating in a memo to employees that they \u201cdeeply value diversity and believe immigration is an essential part of America\u2019s strength.\u201d\n\nWhile there are some examples of the brothers moving to shake up the business, it is not clear how far they will go. In the face of the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News, it was James Murdoch who moved most aggressively against Roger Ailes, the founding chairman of Fox News, and Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nStill, some critics and employees said the Murdochs ousted Mr. Ailes and Mr. O\u2019Reilly only because of public scrutiny, and that the work environment had not been completely reformed.\n\nSome business associates and observers on Friday lauded Mr. Murdoch for taking a stand and making a donation to a charitable organization. Yet others questioned the sincerity behind his motives.\n\nAngelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, a progressive media watchdog, said that Mr. Trump repeated several Fox News talking points during the news conference earlier this week when he responded to questions about what happened in Charlottesville.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMuch of what Donald Trump said this week that James Murdoch is condemning actually came directly from Fox News,\u201d Mr. Carusone said. \u201cSo if James Murdoch really believes what he wrote in that email, then he needs to start with Fox News, the network that he runs.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt is not clear whether James Murdoch cleared the note with his father before sending it, although business associates said that it would be surprising if Rupert Murdoch hadn\u2019t signed off on it.\n\nThe elder Mr. Murdoch has long supported the Anti-Defamation League, and accepted an award from the organization in 2010 for his \u201ccommitment to promoting respect and speaking out against anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nFor James Murdoch, his memo underscores that, at least for him, speaking out against racism, anti-Semitism, white supremacy and neo-Nazis exists outside political ideology.\n\n\u201cBut what we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the president of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people,\u201d Mr. Murdoch said in the email.\n\n\u201cThe presence of hate in our society was appallingly laid bare as we watched swastikas brandished on the streets of Charlottesville and acts of brutal terrorism and violence perpetrated by a racist mob,\u201d he added. \u201cI can\u2019t even believe I have to write this: Standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.\u201d",

Although Scouting offices and social media accounts were besieged with messages condemning the president\u2019s appearance, others celebrated Mr. Trump\u2019s speech in West Virginia. \u201cTrump gave a great speech to the Boy Scouts and they chanted back, \u201cWe love Trump!,\u201d read a Twitter post in the name of Shaun Hough (\u201cPhilosopher, conservative, libertarian\u201d). \u201cI love it!!\u201d\n\nEither way, the firestorm was unwelcome, and unexpected, during one of Scouting\u2019s most important events, a gathering that attracts people from around the world and, very often, presidents, who have typically spoken about service, values and citizenship, not partisan politics.\n\nReaction to the speech, delivered to an enthusiastic audience of saluting and cheering Scouts, was immediate and visceral.\n\nGlenn Elvig, a Minnesota artist who fondly recalled receiving a letter from Richard M. Nixon congratulating him on achieving the Eagle rank decades ago, said he called a Scouting office for hours on Tuesday to express his dismay. He kept getting a busy signal.\n\n\u201cI would like a public denouncement of what happened yesterday and reaffirmation of the values I think I learned in Scouts,\u201d Mr. Elvig said. \u201cIf they can\u2019t do that, I will be returning my medal.\u201d\n\nBrian Alexander, who earned the Eagle rank as a teenager in Ohio, said he was also outraged after seeing clips of Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. Mr. Alexander sent several messages to Boy Scout officials on Twitter, calling the address \u201ca disgrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on my experience with Scouting, the point is you\u2019re supposed to grow up to be someone not like Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Alexander, 32, said in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to grow up to be someone like John McCain or Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Alexander\u2019s complaint, echoed by many other veterans of Scouting, was not that Mr. Trump had been invited to the jamboree, but that he had opted to use his appearance as he did.\n\n\u201cI can guarantee there were people in that audience of 40,000 who agreed with what he said,\u201d said Alvin Townley, the author of \u201cLegacy of Honor,\u201d a frequent gift to newly minted Eagle Scouts. \u201cThere were also plenty of people in that audience who did not agree with what he said, and there were probably plenty of people, whether they agreed with him or not, who felt it was an inappropriate venue to discuss politics.\u201d\n\nIn the opening moments of his appearance, it seemed that Mr. Trump, who was not a Boy Scout as a youth, would mostly avoid talking about the partisan clashes that have riven Washington.\n\nBut Mr. Trump, the 19th occupant of the White House to also serve as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America, ultimately speckled his remarks with political speech that proved startling at a Scout gathering.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said Hillary Clinton \u201cdidn\u2019t work hard\u201d in Michigan, eliciting boos at the mention of his opponent\u2019s name. He resurfaced his grievances with \u201cfake news\u201d and repeatedly doubted that the news media would report the size of the jamboree crowd. And when he landed on the second point of the Scout Law \u2014 loyalty \u2014 Mr. Trump interrupted himself to say, \u201cWe could use some more loyalty, I will tell you that.\u201d\n\nMore than a dozen current Republican officeholders who were Scouts declined to comment or did not respond to messages on Tuesday, but a spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who also attended the jamboree, said that he thought the speech was \u201cvery well received\u201d and that he \u201cappreciated the president taking the time to talk with America\u2019s future leaders.\u201d\n\nSenator Luther Strange, Republican of Alabama and an Eagle Scout, said in a statement: \u201cPresident Donald Trump was absolutely right when he said that the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts and it\u2019s wonderful that he has appointed so many Eagle Scouts to cabinet level positions.\u201d\n\nBut the president\u2019s tone and message alarmed many other people with ties to the Scouts.\n\nAlison Deshotels, whose 11-year-old son, Cole, has been in a Cub Scout pack in Louisiana, said her son had been wary about continuing with the organization, even though he had enjoyed camping and Pinewood Derby races. But after watching the president\u2019s speech, he said he did not want to remain involved.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really agree with anything he was saying,\u201d Cole said in an interview, \u201cand everyone in the Boy Scouts was cheering.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGerald R. Ford is the only president to have earned the Eagle rank, but presidents from both parties have been close to the Scouts: Their signatures have been affixed to Eagle Scout certificates, they have hosted boys and leaders in the Oval Office, and many have appeared at jamborees. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a position to touch a young person and at least create some kind of spark that may lead them to a career in public life, don\u2019t get distracted with your other stuff,\u201d said Michael Dukakis, an Eagle Scout who was governor of Massachusetts and the 1988 Democratic nominee for president.\n\nThe controversy that followed Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance presented another challenge to the Scouts, who have faced frustration and anger in recent decades for policies on gay and transgender people. Although the Scouts have rolled back many of their most controversial rules \u2014 they said this year that they would allow transgender members \u2014 the group has still struggled to cultivate cultural relevance.\n\nThe Scouts\u2019 American affiliate said this year that it had more than 2.3 million youth participants, down from nearly 4.6 million in the late 1990s.\n\nThe Scouts have also faced separate criticism and litigation for the group\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct, which is documented in files that the organization has held closely.\n\nAmid the fallout from Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, which also included an anecdote about an encounter with a New York developer at a cocktail party, some said the Scouts were not at fault.\n\n\u201cThe Boy Scouts were not in the wrong here,\u201d said Zach Wahls, a co-founder of Scouts for Equality, which pressured for changes to membership policies. \u201cWe should not be blaming the organization that always invites the president to speak. We should be talking about the president who took that opportunity and twisted it.\u201d",

        "text": "The classical Greek concept of manliness emphasizes certain traits. The bedrock virtue is courage. The manly man puts himself on the line and risks death and criticism. The manly man is assertive. He does not hang back but instead wades into any fray. The manly man is competitive. He looks for ways to compete with others, to demonstrate his prowess and to be the best. The manly man is self-confident. He knows his own worth. But he is also touchy. He is outraged if others do not grant him the honor that is his due.\n\nThat version of manliness gave Greece its dynamism. But the Greeks came to understand the problem with manly men. They are hard to live with. They are constantly picking fights and engaging in peacock displays.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The Greek tragedies describe cycles of revenge and counter-revenge as manly men and women wreak death and destruction on each other.\n\nSo the Greeks took manliness to the next level. On top of the honor code, they gave us the concept of magnanimity. Pericles is the perfect magnanimous man (and in America, George Washington and George Marshall were his heirs). The magnanimous leader possesses all the spirited traits described above, but he uses his traits not just to puff himself up, but to create a just political order.\n\nThe magnanimous man tries to master the profession of statecraft because he believes, with the Athenian ruler Solon, that the well-governed city \u201cmakes all things wise and perfect in the world of men.\u201d The magnanimous leader tries to beautify his city, to arouse people\u2019s pride in and love for it. He encourages citizens to get involved in great civic projects that will give their lives meaning and allow everybody to partake in the heroic action that was once reserved for the aristocratic few.\n\nThe magnanimous man has a certain style. He is a bit aloof, marked more by gravitas than familiarity. He shows perfect self-control because he has mastered his passions. He does not show his vulnerability. His relationships are not reciprocal. He is eager to grant favors but is ashamed of receiving them. His personal life can wither because he has devoted himself to disinterested public service.\n\nThe magnanimous man believes that politics practiced well is the noblest of all professions. No other arena requires as much wisdom, tenacity, foresight and empathy. No other field places such stress on conversation and persuasion. The English word \u201cidiot\u201d comes from the ancient Greek word for the person who is uninterested in politics but capable only of running his or her own private affairs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToday, we\u2019re in a crisis of masculinity. Some men are unable to compete in schools and in labor markets because the stereotype of what is considered \u201cman\u2019s work\u201d is so narrow. In the White House, we have phony manliness run amok.\n\nBut we still have all these older models to draw from. Of all the politicians I\u2019ve covered, John McCain comes closest to the old magnanimous ideal. Last week, when he went to the Senate and flipped his thumb down on the pretzeled-up health care bill, we saw one version of manliness trumping another. When John Kelly elbowed out Anthony Scaramucci, one version of manliness replaced another.\n\nThe old virtues aren\u2019t totally lost. So there\u2019s hope.",

While many tunnels are rudimentary, others have lighting, tracks and ventilation systems, even elevators. As of March 2016, a total of 224 tunnels were discovered on the Southwest border since 1990.\n\nCargo trains, tractor-trailers and passenger buses have been used to move illegal drugs. Trucks and trains carrying fresh produce such as watermelons, limes and other fruits and vegetables have been used to bring in narcotics. Drug shipments are often painted green and hidden within crates with fake watermelons or limes. Cocaine has been found in tomato crates.\n\nIn recent years, the Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection have started to see small speedboats from Mexico used to smuggle drugs into the United States, particularly in California, in an effort to get around border walls and Border Patrol agents. From 2011 to 2016, border officials said there were 309 known attempts to smuggle drugs across the border using boats; officials said there was no way of knowing how many boats actually reach shore.\n\nDrug trafficking organizations have also taken to the air. Border Patrol and other law enforcement agents have encountered smugglers using ultralight aircraft to conduct drug drops. Customs and Border Protection data showed that ultralight aircraft may have been used to transport drugs on 534 occasions from 2011 to 2016. Drones have also been used.\n\nLess common methods for smuggling drugs include catapults and air compression guns.\n\nIn February, Border Patrol agents near Douglas, Ariz., found and dismantled a catapult that was used by smugglers in Mexico to fire two bundles of marijuana \u2014 weighing about 47 pounds in total \u2014 into the United States.\n\nSince 2012, there were several instances in which Border Patrol agents found smugglers using air guns to launch drugs over border fencing. In one case agents seized more than 30 cans filled with marijuana that had been launched by air guns.\n\nAlthough smugglers have gotten more creative as security has increased, they haven\u2019t completely abandoned old-fashioned forms of transportation, like mules with backpacks.",

With biblical flair, John Kelly, who was brought in as the new chief of staff on Monday to end the fratricidal drama in the White House, demanded the Mooch\u2019s head on a platter.\n\nAnd so it came to pass that the most colorfully bombastic White House official besides the president himself was fired 10 days after he was appointed, and two weeks short of his official start date.\n\nMr. Trump, his daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, suspected Mr. Priebus of being a leaker and had been looking to knife him in the back for a while.

        "text": "Despite nearly two decades of sour relations with Venezuela, the United States has enormous leverage as one of its most important customers and as one the few countries with refineries capable of processing poor-quality heavy crude.\n\nThe Maduro regime is already tottering, struggling to meet its financial obligations, feed its people and pay its oil workers, soldiers and police officers. Additional American sanctions could be a devastating economic blow, prompting the country to move further toward dictatorship and toward an even closer embrace of China and Russia.\n\nThe result could be more violent strife or even a military coup. And shock waves across the hemisphere could create more complications for the Trump administration as it tries to focus on Iran and North Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, who was a top State Department energy envoy in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cTough sanctions could lead to a default on their bonds and a collapse of internal investment and oil production,\u201d he added. \u201cOther impacts could include civil unrest, refugee flows across their borders, and a cutoff of Venezuelan financial support to Cuba and Haiti that could lead to migration flows to the United States.\u201d\n\nThere is also the potential for collateral damage to the United States.\n\nAny trade embargo could raise gasoline prices, cost jobs in the oil patch and dampen profits for several major refiners. A decrease in Venezuelan exports could raise global oil prices, bolstering the economies of Russia and Iran just as Washington prepares to ratchet up sanctions on those countries.\n\nIn briefings, administration officials would not speculate on what would come next, but they emphasized a menu of options. Mr. Trump, in a statement last week, said \u201cthe United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe immediate concern is over Mr. Maduro\u2019s plan to hold an election this weekend for a Constituent Assembly that would circumvent the opposition-controlled Congress and write a new constitution. The new assembly, which is devised to be dominated by groups that support the regime, would presumably consolidate more control in the hands of the president.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have already fled the country, heightening social pressures. The country\u2019s plummeting economy has added pressure on a region struggling with low commodity prices.\n\nFor now, the United States is treading cautiously in its approach to Venezuela.\n\nAs a first step, the administration this week froze assets of, and instituted a ban on travel visas for, 13 influential Venezuelans including electoral, military and correctional officials. One of them is Sim\u00f3n Zerpa, vice president for finance at Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa, which could complicate relations between the state oil company and American players in Venezuela that are already struggling to get paid for services. The move follows similar sanctions imposed by the Trump administration on Venezuela\u2019s vice president, Tareck El Aissami, and eight members of its Supreme Court.\n\nMr. Maduro has repeatedly said that Mr. Trump\u2019s past sanctions against his government are evidence of American imperialism and that current threats will not be heeded. If Mr. Trump \u201chas dared to say \u2018no\u2019 to the Constituent Assembly, we tell him \u2018yes, yes, yes\u2019 \u2014 the Constituent Assembly will go ahead \u2014 Constituent Assembly now more than ever,\u201d Mr. Maduro said recently.\n\nPhoto\n\nMore consequential would be future sanctions to limit American oil companies and service companies from operating in Venezuela or to limit the ability of the Venezuelan national oil company to engage in banking activities in the United States or trade with American companies. That scenario would effectively end Venezuelan oil exports to the United States and prohibit Pdvsa from importing the American light oil used to dilute its heavy crude for transport through pipelines and processing.\n\nSuch moves, at least in the short term, could result in a collapse in production of the oil that Venezuela depends on to get the foreign currency it needs to buy food and to service its debt.\n\n\u201cIt will put Pdvsa on its knees and almost certainly lead to default,\u201d said Francisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan oil expert at Rice University in Houston.\n\nDepending on the details of future sanctions, Citgo, wholly owned by the Venezuelan state oil company, could also be crippled. Citgo operates roughly 4 percent of American refining capacity as well as a sprawling network of pipelines and gasoline stations in the United States.\n\nVenezuela now sells more than 700,000 barrels of oil a day to the United States, out of a total production of roughly two million barrels a day, or just over 2 percent of world production. Energy experts say Venezuela could eventually replace the American market, by exporting more heavy oil to China and India, though at a discount. And the 100,000 barrels a day of light oil it imports from the United States could be replaced by imports from Nigeria and Algeria.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVenezuela would have to move quickly. It faces big bond payments later this year, and its foreign reserves are dwindling.\n\n\u201cThey have shown that they can get along, so I\u2019m not sure suspending the purchasing of 700,000 barrels will crack the government,\u201d said Luis E. Giusti, a former Pdvsa chief executive. \u201cHow much more things will deteriorate compared to what is happening now is a big question that doesn\u2019t have a straightforward answer.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, a cutoff of Venezuelan oil imports would force Chevron, Valero Energy, Phillips 66 and other refiners to replace the heavy crude with imports from places like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, producing higher tanker costs. The administration could sell the refiners supplies from the strategic petroleum reserve to help cushion the blow to their profit margins.\n\n\u201cIn the short term it\u2019s going to be very disruptive,\u201d said Chet M. Thompson, president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a trade group that has been lobbying against sanctions that would disrupt Venezuelan oil imports. \u201cYou are going to end up driving fuel prices up.\u201d",

City officials consider the site an important measure of interest, because nonprofit groups post openings for volunteers there.\n\nNationally, the online service VolunteerMatch has seen activity on its website climb by 7 percent in June, compared with June 2016, its president, Greg Baldwin, said. The site showed increases in crisis support advocacy and hunger, immigration and veterans\u2019 affairs.\n\nBut the largest increase, nearly 199 percent, was in the category VolunteerMatch calls \u201cpolitics.\u201d The 16 volunteer jobs listed recently on its website were for nonpartisan groups dealing with climate change or poverty or human rights.\n\nSanctuary for Families, a New York nonprofit that provides counseling and other services to victims of domestic violence and their children, reported a 15 percent increase in volunteers from its website from Nov. 8 to April 1.\n\n\u201cThe through line is we\u2019ve heard from many people who are reaching out for the first time,\u201d Emily Lo Bue, its director of corporate and volunteer relations, said. Sanctuary for Families uses about 3,000 volunteers a year, she said, including lawyers who donate their time or whose time is donated by law firms.\n\nThe higher numbers came as City Hall completed a study, which was started before the election, that said 48 percent of New Yorkers volunteer in some way \u2014 more than three times the rate reported in the Corporation for National and Community Service\u2019s annual \u201cVolunteering and Civic Life in America Report\u201d last year.

Gavin, the chief service officer in the de Blasio administration, said there had been \u201canecdotes and instincts\u201d that more volunteering was happening in New York than the national numbers indicated. The survey provided data as city officials looked at ways to strengthen volunteer networks around the city.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe national report said volunteers tended to be people who were older, native-born English speakers and college-educated, and owned their own homes and had higher incomes. In the city, Ms. Gavin said, \u201cThe most striking pattern we found in the course of the study was high levels of volunteering even among New Yorkers who don\u2019t fit many of these characteristics.\u201d\n\nAmong the people interviewed, 45.7 percent of those earning $20,000 to $40,000 said they did some type of volunteer work \u2014 a slightly smaller percentage than among those earning $40,000 to $100,000 (48.5 percent) or those making more than $100,000 (50 percent).\n\nAs for education, 51.9 percent of those with college degrees did volunteer work and 63.3 percent with graduate degrees did so, according to the New York study. But the percentage for those who did not finish high school was 45.7 percent, slightly higher than for those with high school diplomas.\n\nThat study also found that the largest number volunteered through religious groups: 30.4 percent, compared with 17.9 percent who volunteered through school groups, 11.6 percent through community service groups and 7.1 percent through neighborhood associations.\n\nHow much the respondents\u2019 interest in volunteering was prompted by national events like President Trump\u2019s election and inauguration was unclear. Laura Rog, the city\u2019s director of volunteer strategy and development, said most of the interviews were conducted before the election. \u201cI think we\u2019re uncovering that people were engaged all along,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong those who said they did not volunteer, time pressures were by far the biggest factor. More than 76 percent of New Yorkers who did not volunteer in the past year cited \u201ctime demands.\u201d\n\nMs. Rog says New Yorkers spend more time commuting to work than people in other places do, and that cuts into the time they could allot for activities like volunteering.\n\nAnother 10 percent said they had not volunteered because no one had asked them to, and 9.6 percent said they did not find the volunteer activities that were available interesting or felt they could not make an \u201cindividual impact.\u201d\n\nMr. Lipsmeyer, the New York Cares volunteer, said he had taken on a second volunteer job, delivering flowers at a home for older adults in Cobble Hill. He said it had been unexpectedly emotional.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe described making the rounds and assuring a resident that the flowers were free.\n\n\u201cThen he said, \u2018You don\u2019t have a cellphone I could borrow to call my daughter?\u2019\u201d Mr. Lipsmeyer recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Here, take my phone.\u2019 I wondered how is this going to go, is it a scam. He hands the phone back. He\u2019s in tears. He says, \u2018You made my day.\u2019\u201d",

Collusion means a quid pro quo.\n\nThere is no evidence Trump Jr. received information remotely usable against Hillary, there is no evidence or suggestion that Jr. promised anything to the Russians if such damaging information were forthcoming, and the story makes clear the probable Russian goal for the meeting was discussion of the Magnitsky Act.\n\nYou can assume otherwise but assumptions alone get you nowhere. So, nope. Still zero evidence of collusion.\n\n\u2014 HurryHarry, New Jersey\n\n\u2018This is an American issue\u2019\n\nThis is not a Democratic or Republican issue, this is an American issue. No one should be okay with a foreign government interfering in our elections.

No dirt was provided. I fail to see why this is newsworthy.\n\nDon\u2019t politicians in election campaigns seek dirt on each other all the time? Are we supposed to get all excited because the source of information, or rather the source of no information at all, was Russian?\n\nI think Trump is a terrible president, but this whole Russia angle that the press has been harping on forever just gets in the way of the real issues, such as Trump\u2019s catastrophic position on global warming. The emphasis on Russia is grossly disproportionate to its importance, which is nil.\n\n\u2014 YaddaYaddaYadda\n\n\u2018The country and world cannot take much more\u2019\n\nHopefully this new information will serve to hasten the end of the Mueller investigation. I lived through the 60\u2019s protests; Watergate; and the debacle that was the end of the Vietnam War. Somehow the country put itself back together but those wounds were not nearly as deep as the ones being forged today between progressives and conservatives.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The country and the world cannot take much more.\n\n\u2014 Linda Bell, Pennsylvania\n\n\u2018There is nothing wrong here\u2019\n\nThere is nothing wrong here. Trump Jr. was baited by a tease: information about wrongful acts by the Clinton camp.\n\nIf there was such information, Trump Jr. would have been bound to take it to the FBI. There was nothing but a plea to repeal an act of Congress, which is an entirely legal process under the Constitution.\n\nTrump Jr. listened and quickly terminated the meeting. The Russians sought to influence U.S. policy. It did not work. Kudos to Trump Jr.\n\n\u2014 lwnieman, Cedarburg, Wis.\n\n\u2018The Russians now know that he can be bought or influenced\u2019\n\nWhat Don Jr. has basically admitted is that he was open to colluding with the Russians to win the election. The fact that he didn\u2019t get anything from this woman is immaterial.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Russians now know that he can be bought or influenced. So much for Trump Senior\u2019s oft-mentioned claim that having billions make you immune to outside pressure and bribery.\n\n\u2014 JTBence, Las Vegas\n\n\u2018Trump cut it short ... end of story\u2019\n\nSo, here\u2019s the chain: Some singer, whose father is in real estate, said something to a tabloid reporter/entertainment lawyer; then, the lawyer said something to Mr. Trump; then, there was a meeting in which it became clear that the woman who wanted the meeting was using the fictitious information \u201cdamaging to Hillary\u201d to meet with Trump about a completely different topic; then, Trump cut it short and ... end of story.\n\n\u2014 Elfego, New York\n\nGrasping at \u2018anything that could help them win\u2019\n\nIf absolutely nothing else, this meeting shows that the Trump campaign did grasp at anything that could help them win, with the involvement of a foreign (hostile) government barely registering as even a minor concern.\n\nIf no further evidence comes to light of collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, it would be a reasonable assumption to think that someone came to their senses and tried to conceal it.\n\n\u2014 Roshanina Ghosh, United Kingdom\n\n\u2018An insane conspiracy theory\u2019\n\nThis is madness. This whole Russia election conspiracy has been an insane conspiracy theory from the getgo. One brief email exchange from somebody offering opposition research in the middle of a presidential campaign and the left is indulging their sick fetish of accusing the current administration of treason and coming up with melodramatic ultimatums. When does the madness end? Why not cooperate with Russia over certain issues? They\u2019re not the Soviet Union!\n\n\u2014 Richie McLaughlin, on The Times\u2019s Facebook page\n\n\u2018You should be extremely worried\u2019\n\nI find it quite disturbing that the American public doesn\u2019t seem to be too concerned about the Russians meddling in your democratic process and having a president who is clearly vulnerable to Russian influence.\n\nWe Europeans know Mr. Putin, and we also know how Russia plays the game. When Trump was elected, it was obvious to everyone that Putin would run rings around him. I think most people assumed that once he became president Mr. Trump would be surrounded by an army of experienced officials that would somehow compensate for the lack of political savvy and diplomatic experience. Little did we know.\n\nYou should be extremely worried that your inexperienced and overconfident joke of a president is isolating your country from old allies and rolling out the red carpet for hostile foreign influence.\n\n\u2014 Kalle Kastemato, Helsinki, Finland",

        "text": "_____\n\n\u2022 Jeet Heer in The New Republic:\n\n\u201cIf Sanders-style democratic socialism is to become the core of the Democratic Party, its adherents will have to win over those who supported Clinton-style progressivism. There are surely few worse ways of accomplishing this than demanding that they \u201cbend the knee,\u201d which is more likely to breed resistance than assent. Convincing Democrats to adopt a more radical politics is challenging enough without trying to insult and humiliate them into submission.\u201d\n\nMr. Heer peers into the political realignment occurring on the left, with a particular focus on what he brands the \u201cdirtbag left.\u201d He looks at how Breitbart, Mike Cernovich and others on the far right were able to recalibrate the Republican Party, but Mr. Heer does not think the same dynamic would work on the other end of the political spectrum. Read more \u00bb\n\n_____\n\nFrom the Right\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2022 David French in National Review:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gigantic law-enforcement scam (in 2014 the government took more money from citizens than burglars stole from crime victims), and it\u2019s a constitutional atrocity. It\u2019s a constitutional atrocity that Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Justice just expanded.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cit\u201d that Mr. French refers to is \u201ccivil asset forfeiture,\u201d a practice where law enforcement can seize property suspected of having been used in a crime. This week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced plans to expand the practice. Using data, examples of wrongly seized property and a hypothetical about his own Toyota pickup truck, Mr. French makes the case for rolling back the practice.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMr. Rove sees trouble among the rank and file as well as the leadership of the governing caucus and concludes that the \u201cmain reason the G.O.P. failed is that party unity and discipline mean nothing to too many Republicans in Congress.\u201d This week\u2019s lurches in political strategy lead him to caution that \u201centhusiasm among party activists and donors\u201d will wane if there is no resolution to the health care debate. Read more \u00bb\n\n_____\n\n\u2022 Kristin Tate in The Hill:\n\n\u201cWill Trump\u2019s commission have a \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on the number of votes cast? Likely not. If past history is any indication, there will be a combination of effects. First, the number of illegal immigrants casting ballots will fall substantially. Secondly, more voters will turn out for a system they feel isn\u2019t rigged against them; remember, candidate Trump turned out so-called \u2018low propensity\u2019 voters just waiting for a person on the ballot that spoke to them, not over them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity has asked all 50 states to provide voter roll information. The request has met with resistance from some secretaries of state and other election officials who voice concerns about privacy and voter suppression. Ms. Tate points out that the federal request is for publicly available data and chides states that \u201cpolitically posture\u201d for not participating. Read more \u00bb\n\n_____\n\nAnd Finally, From the Center:\n\n\u2022 The Washington Post Editorial Board:\n\n\u201cThere is a danger that Americans become so inured to President Trump\u2019s indifference to rule of law that they forget how a president who respected public service and the Constitution \u2014 and had nothing to hide \u2014 would speak and behave. In the interest of jogging memories, we have matched a few of Mr. Trump\u2019s Wednesday comments to The New York Times with imagined quotations of what an ethical president might say.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post editorial board takes a look at Mr. Trump\u2019s comments in a recent interview with Times reporters. The board offers some suggestions of language they think would be helpful for the president to utter. For example, they suggest that when asked about the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, the president might reply: \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to hide. Whatever he wants to look at, he is welcome to look at, and the sooner the better, because the sooner it will prove that I\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nRead more \u00bb\n\n_____\n\n\u2022 Tyler Cowen in Bloomberg\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has some of the most expensive medicine in the world, with health-care spending now almost 18 percent of gross domestic product. But why? And might we hope to get this spending down? Unfortunately, expensive health care is embedded in the American way of life \u2014 more specifically, the American desire to live it up with high consumption.\u201d\n\nMost of the recent national conversation around health care has been framed around ideology. Mr. Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, looks at the financial costs and what they might explain about the philosophy and practice of medicine in the United States. He finds that \u201cAmericans spend a lot on health care because we spend a lot period.\u201d And ultimately, he concludes that this reflects \u201ca kind of American national weakness\u201d that strains health care resources with the burden of overtreatment.\n\nRead more \u00bb\n\n_____\n\n\u2022 Denise Balkissoon in The Globe and Mail:\n\n\u201cGovernment-mandated needles would definitely be drastic, as would keeping students out of school because of their parents\u2019 stubbornness. In this age of redebating basic science, it\u2019s a less medieval choice than watching a child die of whooping cough.\u201d\n\nMs. Balkissoon identifies the problem like this: \u201cWith vaccinations down in rich countries, the issue has become what to do with those who refuse their responsibilities.\u201d She finds an answer in France, where the government recently announced it would increase the number of mandatory vaccinations for public-school students as of 2018. Ms. Balkissoon would like to see the same in her native Canada, and a recent op-ed in The Houston Chronicle makes the same case for Texas.\n\nRead more \u00bb\n\n_____\n\nWant the Partisan Writing Roundup in your inbox?

(Some may find that descriptor harsh, but I find no appellation too coarse to express my outrage over Trump\u2019s character, behavior and agenda.

And Trump gave an astoundingly bizarre interview to The New York Times in which he publicly slammed his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from the Russia investigation and drew a \u201cred line,\u201d warning that Mueller should not investigate the Trump family\u2019s business dealings.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

And the bank is expecting to eventually have to provide information to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel overseeing the federal investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.\u201d\n\nNot only did NBC report that \u201cMarc Kasowitz is no longer leading the president\u2019s group of private lawyers,\u201d Politico reported that Mark Corallo, spokesman for the Trump legal team, resigned because he \u201cwas concerned about whether he was being told the truth about various matters.\u201d\n\nIf people on Trump\u2019s legal payroll are worried that they aren\u2019t being told the truth, how worried should the rest of us be? Very, I would venture.\n\nThen there was the Washington Post report: \u201cSome of President Trump\u2019s lawyers are exploring ways to limit or undercut\u201d Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, \u201cbuilding a case against what they allege are his conflicts of interest and discussing the president\u2019s authority to grant pardons, according to people familiar with the effort.\u201d\n\nThe Post continued: \u201cTrump has asked his advisers about his power to pardon aides, family members and even himself in connection with the probe, according to one of those people.\u201d\n\nI understand the press giving a lot of attention to the drama of changing press people, but that doesn\u2019t even register against the import of what\u2019s happening on the Russia investigation front.\n\nAll those things that have never made sense \u2014 Trump\u2019s warm-and-fuzzies for Vladimir Putin, the mass amnesia about meetings with Russians by people connected to the Trump campaign, Trump\u2019s prickly protectiveness about releasing financial details and documents, including his tax returns \u2014 must be made to make sense.\n\nMueller will not be threatened, the investigation will not be closed or constricted and the truth will be known. Incriminating personal communications are often hard to find, but financial records are often also kept by third parties and tell their own story.\n\nAs they say, follow the money.",

        "source": "The New York Times",
        "summary": "Trump is the first sitting president to make an appearance at a U.S. Women\u2019s Open, so no one was surprised that his arrival overshadowed the golf.\nHe tweeted about coming to the U.S. Women\u2019s Open.\nAngela Stanford, a member of six United States Solheim Cup teams, finished her round of 72 a couple of hours before Trump\u2019s arrival.\nShe said it was \u201cpretty cool\u201d that Trump had carved time out of his busy schedule to attend the tournament.\n\u201cI respect the office of the president,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cHow many chances are you going to get to play on a president\u2019s golf course during a U.S. Open?\u201d",
        "text": "She added: \u201cI had heard he was coming to the course today. I tried not to focus on it too much.\u201d\n\nShanshan Feng of China, who holds a two-stroke lead, at eight under, played in the group directly behind Thompson. As she approached the 15th green, she wondered what all the yelling and screaming was about. She knew the cheering probably was not for her.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI was still really focusing on my game,\u201d said Feng, who posted a 70.\n\nA few miles outside the club grounds, anti-Trump activists gathered to protest the United States Golf Association\u2019s choice to work with a Trump-owned property to hold the most prestigious women\u2019s event in America. But inside the gates, Trump received a different reception.\n\nMost of the players described his presence as a welcome distraction. By showing up, Trump elevated the profile of the women, whose attendance and television audience have not grown as fast as their talent pool, which is so deep that the first 18 events of the 2017 L.P.G.A. Tour season produced 17 different winners.\n\nTrump is the first sitting president to make an appearance at a U.S. Women\u2019s Open, so no one was surprised that his arrival overshadowed the golf. The group playing directly ahead of Thompson\u2019s became stuck in traffic when Trump\u2019s motorcade passed the clubhouse, which sits between the ninth green and the 10th tee.\n\nAlison Walshe and Lauren Stephenson, both Americans, and Weiwei Zhang of China were held for six minutes by security personnel under a makeshift shelter off the ninth green before being allowed to proceed to the 10th tee.\n\nThey ran into another jam, this time involving human traffic, on the 15th green and the 16th tee. On the par-3 16th, fans congregated on the balcony of the clubhouse and around the base of Trump\u2019s suite and shouted, \u201cMake America great again!\u201d \u2014 among other things \u2014 as the players were hitting their tee shots.\n\nThe fans buzzed around Trump\u2019s suite, trying to get a better view of him as he stood at the windows, staring out at the crowd and waving.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a little distracting,\u201d said Stephenson, a 20-year-old amateur who has posted consecutive 72s. \u201cWe had a lot of people yelling and just a lot of movement, but it\u2019s pretty cool to be in the presence of the president, so I guess he gets a pass.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe juxtaposition of a golf tournament and a presidential visit created some surreal scenes. A member of the kitchen staff was scanned with a wand by security personnel before he could take a tray of food into the clubhouse. A player walking down the steps of the clubhouse did a double take as three Secret Service agents passed her on their way up.\n\n\u201cThat was kind of what intrigued me to start the week,\u201d said Stacy Lewis, a former world No. 1 who played in the same group as Thompson. \u201cWe never had an active sitting president at one of our events, so I was kind of excited about the prospect of, regardless of who it is, that he came here to watch us. He tweeted about coming to the U.S. Women\u2019s Open. Some people didn\u2019t know it was going on.\u201d\n\nAs Trump\u2019s motorcade snaked toward the clubhouse, scattered cheers erupted from fans, some of whom stood in a steady rain for more than a half-hour. Carlota Ciganda of Spain, who was exhausted after a long day on which she had awakened early to finish the final hole of her first round and then turn around and play 18 holes of her second, became an accidental spectator. She arrived at the valet pickup spot shortly before Trump came through and had to wait 20 minutes to retrieve her courtesy car.\n\nAngela Stanford, a member of six United States Solheim Cup teams, finished her round of 72 a couple of hours before Trump\u2019s arrival. She said it was \u201cpretty cool\u201d that Trump had carved time out of his busy schedule to attend the tournament.\n\n\u201cI respect the office of the president,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cHow many chances are you going to get to play on a president\u2019s golf course during a U.S. Open?\u201d",

        "text": "On MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Thursday, I presented charts explaining that while President Trump has been dispatching self-congratulatory tweets about his economic stewardship, he has little to brag about, apart from the stock market. The economy continues to grow and add jobs at roughly the same rate it did under President Barack Obama.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump did get a post-election bump according to a number of metrics, that glow has faded. Trump voters appear to be increasingly frustrated with everything from the new administration\u2019s failure to enact significant legislation to Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets.\n\nThis University of Michigan chart shows how consumer expectations jumped immediately after the election but have since dropped back to below where they were last November and close to recent lows.\n\nConsumers Less Sanguine University of Michigan consumer expectations index 95 90 85 80 75 80.2 2016 2017 95 90 85 80 75 80.2 April July Oct. 2016 April July Oct. 2017 April July\n\nDeclining confidence may be part of why retail sales growth has recently been slowing. As this chart shows, retail spending had been increasing steadily at 3.5 percent to 5 percent. Here again, President Trump may have gotten a post-election bump, but more recently, core retail sales growth has dropped to 2.6 percent, the lowest in more than three years.\n\nRetail Sales Growth Declining Retail and food services sales excluding gasoline and auto sales, change from a year earlier 6 5 4 3 2.6 2015 2016 2017 % 6 4 2 0 2.6% 2015 April July Oct. 2016 April July Oct. 2017 April\n\nOther indicators, like the second-quarter forecast for gross domestic product, have been steadily revised downward because of the lack of progress on policy priorities and continued Washington dysfunction. This has dashed hopes for the 3 percent sustained growth rate promised by the Trump administration and contributed to growing concern among economists.\n\nLate last year, about 40 percent of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal thought the economy was more likely to underperform their growth forecasts. After the election, that percentage dropped to 25 percent. Now it is up to 57 percent, the highest since before November of last year.",

Not so new that he can\u2019t reinvent the government, broker peace in the Middle East, spearhead our negotiations with countries elsewhere in the world, make headway against the opioid epidemic, reform the criminal justice system and still carve out time to tackle the slopes of Aspen with Ivanka and the kids. But paperwork? Be reasonable. He\u2019s Superman. He\u2019s not Ant-Man, the Green Hornet and the Green Lantern, too.\n\nToo bad, because he\u2019s in way over his faintly tousled hair, and that becomes clearer and clearer as the probes into the Trump campaign\u2019s interactions with Russia intensify.\n\nHis actions are under scrutiny. Why was he trying to set up a private back channel for communications with Russia? Did he furnish Russian players with the fruits of the campaign data operation that he supervised? Have his business interests profited from his proximity to the president? CNN reported on Friday that Chinese-language promotions for a New Jersey real estate development by Kushner Companies specifically mention that \u201cthe celebrity of the family is 30-something \u2018Mr. Perfect\u2019 Jared Kushner.\u201d\n\nMr. Perfect indeed. Perfectly opportunistic. Perfectly armored in the rosiest self-regard. And perfectly reflective of his father-in-law in those ways and a few others.\n\nHe and the president once ran family businesses and now run the White House like one, with a narrowly drawn circle of trust and a suspiciousness of \u2014 and chilliness toward \u2014 those outside it. Note that Sean Spicer\u2019s resignation came little more than a week after reports that Kushner was in a lather about press aides not devising more forceful and creative ways to answer negative coverage of the Russian meeting.

But in Kushner\u2019s case \u2014 in Ivanka Trump\u2019s, too \u2014 that has been an especially perverse spectacle. He and she are the prince and princess of having it both ways.\n\nThey expect our gratitude for their supposed (and only occasionally successful) efforts to tame Trump. But they\u2019re also the ones who worked so mightily to put him in a position where, untamed, he can do such damage. It\u2019s as if they deliberately shattered a glass, grabbed a broom and then solicited applause for their sweeping.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey cover for the president still. Smack in the middle of his cockamamie interview with The Times last week, Ivanka dropped by the Oval Office so that her daughter, Arabella, could give Grandpa a kiss. How precious. How humanizing. How entirely choreographed.\n\nGrandpa spent the duration of his campaign mocking the establishment swells who migrate to enclaves like Davos, Switzerland, and Sun Valley, Idaho, for high-altitude, highfalutin conferences on the conundrums of modern life. That didn\u2019t stop Kushner and Ivanka from joining those very swells in Sun Valley a week and a half ago for precisely such a symposium-on-the-slopes.\n\nI\u2019m told that their presence had a dampening effect on formal panels and informal conversations \u2014 how do you take issue with Trump when there\u2019s family listening in? \u2014 and that a few glares came their way. I wonder if they even noticed.\n\nThey\u2019re outsiders when that\u2019s politically advantageous, insiders as soon as the canap\u00e9s come around. Not long before Sun Valley they swanned up to the Hamptons for a party at the home of the Washington Post pooh-bah Lally Weymouth. There, in one of the global elite\u2019s premier beachheads, they chatted radiantly with Democrats, whom Trump demonizes, and members of the news media, which Trump has cast as an enemy of the American people.\n\nIt\u2019s an elaborate moral jujitsu they perform. There\u2019s one constant \u2014 their self-advancement and self-preservation \u2014 but Kushner may be overplaying his hand.\n\nHis counsel to Trump has been flawed, to say the least. He reportedly lobbied for the firing of James Comey, which didn\u2019t turn out so well. Maybe the hiring of Anthony Scaramucci as the new White House communications director \u2014 a move blessed by Kushner, over the objections of Reince Priebus, the chief of staff \u2014 will prove wiser. I have my doubts.\n\nCast as one of the president\u2019s most dependable assets, Kushner could in fact be a significant liability, someone whose escapades \u2014 by turns grabby and cavalier \u2014 give investigators and detractors a whole extra sandbox of improprieties to rummage through.\n\nI hear that he feels persecuted. Wronged. In that regard, too, he\u2019s like his father-in-law, though Trump wears his self-pity, fury and ruthlessness right out front, for the whole world to see. Kushner puts a pale mask of calm and courteousness over his.\n\nMaybe the senators who question him on Monday will pry it off. Maybe they\u2019ll actually bring some color to his face. We won\u2019t be able to witness what happens. But we\u2019ll find out.",

He could support the appointment of an experienced and respected neutral mediator \u2014 neither American nor Afghan \u2014 who could seek to generate and sustain momentum for a peace process that will inevitably be buffeted by spikes in violence and wavering political attention spans.\n\nIn Afghanistan, unexceptionally, there are vested interests on all sides in continuing the war because of the resources conflict attracts, antipathies toward sharing power, and the difficulty of justifying compromise with an enemy against the backdrop of human losses and entrenched narratives.\n\nThe United States can surmount these hurdles by influencing the Taliban\u2019s calculations through applying military pressure and offering political opportunity, and using our leverage with the Afghan political elite to ensure their commitment to negotiating.\n\nThe Taliban is violently opposed to the United States military presence on Afghan soil but does not have aspirations beyond Afghanistan. A peace deal could allow the United States to focus its resources on threats from the region that are directed toward the homeland and core American interests.\n\nPursuing peace is also the most effective way of managing the region\u2019s hedgers and spoilers. There is a consensus among Iran, Russia and Pakistan, as well as the more constructively minded Chinese, for a political settlement. Views on desirable terms no doubt differ, but this consensus is an opportunity for the United States.\n\nPakistan is the most problematic of the regional powers as it continues offering sanctuary to the Taliban. Pakistan wants a political arrangement in Afghanistan to be hospitable to its interests and inhospitable to Indian interests. But Pakistan would be inclined to support a political settlement that takes seriously its perception of its interests in its own neighborhood.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA peace deal won\u2019t happen quickly or easily.

Bush tax cut, the Clinton deficit plan and the Obama stimulus, health bill and financial regulation. Some intraparty tensions are unavoidable, and defectors kill some legislation \u2014 as happened with the Clinton health plan and the Obama climate plan.

And the loyalty doesn\u2019t stop in the first year. During Watergate, as the political scientist Jonathan Bernstein has noted, most Republicans stood by Richard Nixon until almost the bitter end.\n\nMatt Glassman, another political scientist, is one of the sharper observers of the White House-Congress relationship, and I asked him to put the current situation in context. Glassman said that many progressives have made the mistake of comparing how they want Congress to treat Trump with what it is doing. The more relevant yardstick is how Congress\u2019s treatment compares historically.\n\n\u201cThe current congressional G.O.P. seems less supportive and more constraining of the Potus than basically any in history,\u201d Glassman wrote to me, \u201csave the unique circumstances of Andrew Johnson (who wasn\u2019t really a Republican) and John Tyler (who bucked his party aggressively), neither of whom were elected.\u201d\n\nMany of today\u2019s Republicans avoid going on television as Trump surrogates. They mock him off the record, and increasingly on the record, too. In recent weeks, eight senators have publicly stood in the way of a health care bill. Republican senators are also helping to conduct an investigation of Trump\u2019s campaign and have backed the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel.\n\nOne reason is that they don\u2019t fear Trump. About 90 percent of Republican House members won a larger vote share in their district last year than Trump did, according to Sarah Binder of George Washington University. Since he took office, Trump\u2019s nationwide net approval rating has fallen to minus 16 (with only 39 percent approving) from plus 4.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo it\u2019s not just Republican politicians who are inching away from Trump. Republican voters are, too.\n\nNone of this is meant to suggest that congressional Republicans have been profiles in courage. They haven\u2019t been. They have mostly stood by as Trump has lied compulsively, denigrated the rule of law and tried to shred the modern safety net. But they have put up just enough resistance to keep him from doing far more damage than he otherwise would have.\n\nIn the months ahead, unfortunately, that level of resistance is unlikely to be sufficient. Trump has made clear that he isn\u2019t finished trying to take health insurance away from millions of people or trying to hide the truth about his Russia ties. \u201cThe constitutional crisis won\u2019t be if Trump fires Mueller,\u201d as the A.C.L.U.\u2019s Kate Oh put it. \u201cThe constitutional crisis is if Congress takes no real action in response.\u201d\n\nFor now, anxious optimism \u2014 or maybe optimistic anxiety \u2014 seems the appropriate attitude.",

        "text": "At an hourlong meeting last Wednesday, all of the president\u2019s major security advisers recommended he preserve the Iran deal for now. Among those who spoke out were Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson; Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser; and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, according to an official who described internal discussions on the condition of anonymity. The official said Mr. Trump had spent 55 minutes of the meeting telling them he did not want to.\n\nMr. Trump did not want to certify Iran\u2019s compliance the first time around either, but was talked into it on the condition that his team come back with a new strategy to confront Tehran, the official said. Last week, advisers told the president they needed more time to work with allies and Congress. Mr. Trump responded that before he would go along, they had to meet certain conditions, said the official, who would not outline what the conditions were.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump headed to Paris and then spent the weekend in New Jersey, his team developed a strategy that it hoped would satisfy him and planned to notify Congress and make the case publicly on Monday. But even as allies were quietly being informed, Mr. Trump balked when he heard the plan at his morning security briefing, the official said. The argument continued during a separate meeting with Mr. Tillerson as Mr. Trump pressed for more action, the official said.\n\nSuddenly, a background briefing to announce the decision was postponed and Mr. Spicer was sent out to assure reporters that a decision would be coming \u201cvery shortly,\u201d while aides scrambled to satisfy Mr. Trump. He agreed only late in the day after a final meeting in the Oval Office, in effect telling his advisers that he was giving them another chance and this time they had to deliver. The announcement was then rescheduled for the early evening and a notice was sent to Congress to continue withholding nuclear-related sanctions against Iran.\n\nVideo\n\nUnder the agreement, the United States can still penalize Iran for behavior such as its development of ballistic missiles or support for terrorism, but it cannot simply reapply the same sanctions that were lifted under a different guise. Iran has the right to appeal to a joint committee and make the argument that the United States is in violation.\n\nEuropean officials have long argued that the agreement was intended only to restrict Iran\u2019s nuclear program, not the panoply of other issues. If the international community were to do more to confront Tehran over its efforts to destabilize neighbors in the Middle East, European officials have said, it would be better to face an Iran without nuclear weapons. They have shown little enthusiasm for revisiting the deal, much less undercutting it.\n\nThat Mr. Trump\u2019s actions will satisfy conservatives who have been urging him to rip up the Iran deal seemed unlikely. In a column in The Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, John R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations who has interviewed with the president for several jobs in the administration, argued that the nuclear agreement \u201cremains palpably harmful to American national interests.\u201d Withdrawing from it, he said, \u201cshould be the highest priority.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Putin of Russia, fearing it will leave Iran as a major player on the ground in the six-year civil war. Mr. Spicer said the administration would address that with Israel. \u201cThere\u2019s a shared interest that we have with Israel, making sure that Iran does not gain a foothold, military base-wise, in southern Syria,\u201d Mr. Spicer said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTehran\u2019s clerical government argues that Mr. Trump has already violated the nuclear agreement by pressuring businesses not to engage with Iran even though the nuclear sanctions have been lifted. \u201cThat is violation of not the spirit but of the letter of the J.C.P.O.A. of the nuclear deal,\u201d Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS\u201d on Sunday, using the initials for the agreement.\n\nMr. Zarif, visiting New York, told a gathering of the Council on Foreign Relations on Monday that he has yet to talk with Mr. Tillerson, unlike his frequent conversations with former Secretary of State John Kerry, with whom he negotiated the nuclear accord.\n\nIn an interview on Monday with Jacob Heilbrunn, editor of The National Interest, a foreign policy journal, Mr. Zarif raised the prospect that Iran would be the one to back out. \u201cIf it comes to a major violation, or what in the terms of the nuclear deal is called significant nonperformance, then Iran has other options available, including withdrawing from the deal,\u201d he said.\n\nThat would be an outcome welcomed by the Trump administration. Top officials like Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis have expressed concern about the effect on American relations with European allies if Mr. Trump were to unilaterally pull out, especially after he already announced his intention to back out of the Paris climate change accord that Europeans strongly support.\n\nBut some advisers to the president argue that if they can provoke Iran into being the one to scrap the nuclear deal, it will leave the United States in a stronger position.\n\nMr. Trump has aligned the United States with Sunni Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, as well as Israel in their mutual struggle with Shiite-led Iran over control of the Middle East. His administration has already announced modest new sanctions against Iran, but nothing on the scale of those imposed before the nuclear agreement.",

Legend has it that he used a cork to seal in the fizz, but the veracity of the quote \u2014 as well as the idea that he invented Champagne \u2014 have long been refuted by historians.\n\nThe evolution of some wine \u2014 from still to one with bubbles \u2014 in the Champagne region of France was more an innovation of happenstance. Wine bottles would explode at random, earning the name \u201cle vin du diable,\u201d or the devil\u2019s wine. Fizzy wine wasn\u2019t desirable, and removing the fizz was a problem.\n\nThe first documentation of sparkling wine (in the Limoux region) was in 1531. A paper in 1662 described how winemakers would add sugar to give it sparkle \u2014 making it \u201cdifferent than any other drink in the world,\u201d as Hans Koningsberger wrote in The Times in 1958.\n\nDom P\u00e9rignon did, however, develop the techniques that led to the development of modern-day Champagne. Call it fizz, bubbles or sparkles, we can thank the monk and his legacy for the \u201cwine of happiness.\u201d\n\nDanielle Belopotosky contributed reporting.\n\n_____\n\nThis briefing was prepared for the European morning.

The committees ramped up their big-donor fund-raising during the second quarter of the year, raising $13.2 million \u2014 much of which came from big donors \u2014 according to the reports.\n\nThe reports make it clear that although Election Day 2020 is nearly three and a half years away, Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign operation is already in high gear, and that it is working to engage the Republican Party\u2019s deepest pockets in a way that his unconventional 2016 campaign did not.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And that probably does not reflect most of the checks collected in connection with a fund-raiser at the end of last month at Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington hotel, which raised an estimated $10 million from 300 guests who each donated at least $35,000.\n\nTrump Victory \u2014 a joint fund-raising committee comprising the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and a number of state Republican parties \u2014 reported $100,000 donations from, among others, the Florida sugar baron Jos\u00e9 Fanjul, the Quicken Loans executive Shawn M. Krause and the Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe commission reports show that donors who contributed $200 or less accounted for less than 38 percent of all funds raised in the second quarter. That is a reversal from Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, when small donors accounted for a majority of the outside donations raised by his committees, not including the $66 million he donated to his campaign.\n\nIn some ways, the shift to high-dollar fund-raising represents a move toward a more traditional political operation than the one that helped power Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory. In 2016, his campaign relied more on donations from Mr. Trump\u2019s own pocket (he has not donated to his re-election campaign) and on the power of mega-rallies and his social media presence than on traditional \u2014 and costly \u2014 political infrastructure like field offices and television advertising.\n\nIt is unusual, however, for a sitting president\u2019s team to be raising money and building a re-election effort in the first half of a first term, when political and fund-raising efforts are typically channeled through the president\u2019s national party committee.\n\nThe reports show that Mr. Trump\u2019s committees spent $229,000 on salaries and political and communications consulting. The committees spent $2.1 million on digital consulting, all of which went to firms associated with the San Antonio-based consultant Brad Parscale, who served as digital director of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, and who is now advising a nonprofit group seeking to raise huge sums of cash to boost Mr. Trump\u2019s legislative agenda.\n\nMr. Parscale and the Trump campaign data operation have attracted the interest of congressional investigators looking into the Trump campaign\u2019s digital operation in connection with the Russia investigations. On Friday, Mr. Parscale posted on Twitter that he had accepted an invitation to appear before the House Intelligence Committee, writing, \u201cI am unaware of any Russian involvement in the digital and data operation of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nMr. Parscale\u2019s firms were by far the highest-paid vendors on the Trump committee\u2019s payrolls. And those payments seem to indicate that Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election operation will again rely heavily on social media and other digital targeting of voters, which is credited with helping to harness grass-roots support for his candidacy. To that end, the reports also show that the committees spent nearly $500,000 on data management services in the second quarter.\n\nThe reports filed Saturday also show that the committees spent nearly $200,000 on Trump-branded merchandise, including more than $80,000 toward hats. In 2016, hats featuring the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d became symbols for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.",

        "text": "Advertisement\n\nTrump Says He Has Signed More Bills Than Any President, Ever. He Hasn\u2019t.\n\nImage President Trump signed two bills into law during a ceremony in the Diplomatic Reception Room last month. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 To hear President Trump tell it, his first six months in the White House should be judged in part by the legislation he has signed into law.\n\nAt rallies, in speeches and on Twitter, Mr. Trump repeatedly boasts of the bills he has signed \u2014 42 as of this week. He has said no president has \u201cpassed more legislation,\u201d conceding once earlier this year that he trails Franklin D. Roosevelt, who he notes \u201chad a major Depression to handle.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, he went even further, claiming to have bested all of his predecessors in turning bills into law.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve signed more bills \u2014 and I\u2019m talking about through the legislature \u2014 than any president, ever,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a \u201cMade in America\u201d event at the White House. \u201cFor a while, Harry Truman had us. And now, I think, we have everybody.\u201d\n\nTurning to Vice President Mike Pence, he added an aside about news media fact-checkers: \u201cI better say \u2018think\u2019; otherwise they will give you a Pinocchio. And I don\u2019t like Pinocchios.\u201d\n\nIn fact, as he approaches six months in office on Thursday, Mr. Trump is slightly behind the lawmaking pace for the past six presidents, who as a group signed an average of 43 bills during the same period. And an analysis of the bills Mr. Trump signed shows that about half were minor and inconsequential, passed by Congress with little debate. Among recent presidents, both the total number of bills he signed and the legislation\u2019s substance make Mr. Trump about average.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter signed 70 bills in the first six months, according to an analysis of bills signed by previous White House occupants. Bill Clinton signed 50. George W. Bush signed 20 bills into law. Barack Obama signed 39 bills during the period, including an $800 billion stimulus program to confront an economic disaster, legislation to make it easier for women to sue for equal pay, a bill to give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco and an expansion of the federal health insurance program for children.\n\nMr. Truman and Franklin Delano Roosevelt both had signed more bills into law by their 100-day mark than Mr. Trump did in almost twice that time. Truman had signed 55 bills and Roosevelt had signed 76 during their first 100 days.\n\nMr. Trump has signed several significant bills, many in the works on Capitol Hill since well before he arrived in the Oval Office, as is often the case for new presidents.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s allies point to a bill he signed to improve accountability and overhaul services at the scandal-plagued Veterans Affairs Department. They note that the president signed into law spending plans that will significantly raise federal expenditures on the military and border security. And they say Mr. Trump and the Republican-led Congress worked to methodically reduce the burden of government regulation.\n\nThat effort to undo regulation involved 15 new laws, which were the result of an aggressive push to employ a little-used legislative tool to roll back government rules put in place by former President Barack Obama. Those new laws could result in a significant shift in the way government regulates employee benefits, worker safety, the environment, public lands and education.\n\n\u201cThese repeal bills are now law, which means those Obama regulations have been struck from the books \u2014 forever,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said recently.\n\nAnd legislation is not the only tool presidents can wield to enact their agendas. His aides note that Mr. Trump has used executive orders, such as his ban on travel to the United States for refugees and those living in some Muslim countries, to get around what they say is unprecedented obstruction by Democrats. And he successfully won confirmation of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut almost half the other bills Mr. Trump has signed into law are ceremonial or routine. The president includes in his count laws like the one to rename the federal courthouse in Nashville after Fred Thompson, the actor and former senator who died in 2015. Even the Republican leadership in the Senate does not count those kinds of bills when they tally their legislative achievements.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Trump\u2019s tally includes three laws to appoint members to the Smithsonian Board of Regents, another to seek research into better weather reports, and one to require the Department of Homeland Security to manage its fleet of vehicles more efficiently.\n\nMarc Short, the president\u2019s top legislative adviser, acknowledged that no one would try to claim that renaming a building should be considered \u201clandmark legislation.\u201d But he defended the president\u2019s repeated promotion of the bills he has signed into law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a response to a lot of media coverage that has tried to downplay what he\u2019s accomplished,\u201d Mr. Short said. \u201cThere\u2019s an overarching coverage about what\u2019s not been accomplished. The president is trying to point out what we actually have done.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has signed two budget bills that would be required of any president. He signed a law largely endorsing the budget for NASA that Mr. Obama had laid out. And Mr. Trump temporarily extended Mr. Obama\u2019s program that gives veterans a choice of seeing a private doctor in certain cases.\n\nThe president complains that he has not gotten the news coverage he deserves for his legislative achievements, though his bill signings are often aired live on television and his push to reverse regulations has been widely covered .\n\nMr. Trump may yet assemble a more far-reaching legislative record. Getting comprehensive legislation through Congress and to the president\u2019s desk takes time, even when the president\u2019s party controls both chambers of Congress.\n\nBy the end of his tenure, Mr. Bush had signed major tax cuts, expanded surveillance with the Patriot Act, authorized votes to wage war, overhauled federal education laws, established free-trade deals and expanded Medicare to include prescription drugs. Mr. Obama eventually passed the Affordable Care Act and imposed new rules on financial services firms. Roosevelt created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Tennessee Valley Authority, enacted Social Security and started public works projects in response to the Great Depression, and began farm subsidies.\n\nSince Mr. Trump took office, the House has passed a health care overhaul, and Republicans have talked about a major infrastructure bill and an overhaul of taxes.\n\nBut for him to compile major legislative achievements will take time, said David R. Mayhew, a professor of political science at Yale who tracks the legislative achievements of American presidents.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, Congress needs many months to do something big,\u201d he said.\n\nHere is a rundown of the 42 bills Mr. Trump has signed into law:\n\nVeterans Bills\n\nMr. Trump frequently points to his work on behalf of veterans, who supported him by almost two to one over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, as evidence of his legislative success. At a recent rally on behalf of military families, Mr. Trump bragged that he had signed legislation that \u201cwent through the House, went through the Senate, and I signed it really fast.\u201d\n\nThat law was the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act , which will allow officials to remove bad employees and promote whistle-blowing, passed in response to a scandal over manipulating patient wait times. The new law puts in place long-sought changes to overhaul management of the department and improve health care and benefits for veterans.\n\nImage Sean Spicer, center, the White House press secretary, listened as Mr. Trump spoke during a signing event for the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act bill last month. Credit Al Drago for The New York Times\n\nJohn Hoellwarth, the national communications director for Amvets, called the new law \u201ca positive step\u201d but said it was a small part of overall improvements at the department that had been put in place, slowly, for years.\n\n\u201cA lot of the things that are moving the Department of Veterans Affairs in the right direction actually got underway before the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Hoellwarth said, noting that Mr. Trump had appointed a former Obama administration official to be his secretary of veterans affairs.\n\nAnother bill that Mr. Trump signed extended an Obama-era program that allows some veterans to see private doctors, and streamlined the way their deductibles and co-pays get processed. The law is essentially an accounting maneuver intended to give lawmakers more time to debate more substantive changes.\n\nA third new law allows community policing grants to be used to hire and train veterans to be officers.\n\nReversal of Obama Regulations\n\nSince becoming law in 1996, the Congressional Review Act has allowed presidents to use legislation to roll back his predecessor\u2019s regulations. But until Mr. Trump took office, that power had been used only once \u2014 by Mr. Bush, who reversed a rule on workplace injuries. Working with the Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Trump has used it 15 times to unravel what he said were overly burdensome regulations imposed on Americans and businesses.\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 34 eliminated a rule by the Federal Communications Commission that would have prohibited internet providers from collecting, sharing or selling consumers\u2019 information without their permission. Another, House Joint Resolution 38 , nullified a regulation that would have required coal companies to make sure that waste from mountaintop mining was not polluting local waterways.\n\nImage A mountaintop removal coal mining operation in Wise County, Va., in April 2012. Credit Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nCollectively, the 15 regulatory laws may represent the president\u2019s broadest legislative impact, though they are less about doing things and more about undoing them. Signing the bills into law allowed the president, with the flick of a pen, to erase rules on the environment, labor, financial protections, internet privacy, abortion, education and gun rights.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s saving about $18 billion a year in compliance costs,\u201d Mr. Short said, including the impact of the president\u2019s executive orders that seek to reverse regulations. \u201cWe think they are a huge part of the economic success of the first six months.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Trump can no longer use the tool.\n\nThe review act gives presidents and lawmakers 60 legislative days to rapidly roll back major regulations put in place by a previous administration. That deadline has passed. If Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers want to overturn any more Obama-era regulations, they will have to do it through the normal lawmaking or regulatory processes, which can take years.\n\nSpace and Science\n\nNew presidents often use their first months in office to sign noncontroversial legislation that has broad bipartisan support. Four of the laws Mr. Trump cites as evidence of his success involved NASA or science and generated little opposition.\n\nMr. Trump signed legislation that approved nearly $20 billion in spending for NASA, keeping its financing level almost unchanged from Mr. Obama\u2019s budget. The budget would allow NASA to pursue sending humans to Mars during the next two decades, and would continue work on rockets that have long been in development.\n\nA separate law calls for research on improving weather reports, though it provides no additional funds for the effort. The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to prioritize \u201cweather data, modeling, computing, forecasts, and warnings for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy.\u201d\n\nFinally, two laws are aimed at encouraging women to participate more fully in scientific endeavors. The Inspire Women Act \u2014 Inspiring the Next Space Pioneers, Innovators, Researchers, and Explorers Women Act \u2014 requires the NASA administrator to \u201cencourage women and girls to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, pursue careers in aerospace.\u201d The Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act seeks to encourage the creation of entrepreneurial programs to recruit women for science, math and technical careers.\n\nBureaucratic Tweaks\n\nAs a candidate, Mr. Trump vowed to wage an all-out assault on the federal bureaucracy. Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s senior strategist, has promised a daily fight for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s legislative assault has moved slowly. The four bills designed to improve government functions that he has signed into law since taking office have made only small tweaks.\n\nOne law, called the GAO Access and Oversight Act of 2017 , gives the Government Accountability Office more power to compel other agencies to provide information during its investigations. The Follow the Rules Act clarifies existing whistle-blower laws to make it clear that protections apply to employees who refuse a superior\u2019s orders to break an existing rule or regulation.\n\nImage An Uber driver in San Francisco. Mr. Trump signed legislation allowing government employees to seek reimbursement for official travel using Uber and other ride-hailing companies. Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times\n\nThe Modernizing Government Travel Act would give government employees the right to seek reimbursement for official travel by Uber, Lyft or other ride-hailing companies. Previously, the government would not reimburse such expenses. And the Stop Asset and Vehicle Excess Act \u2014 the SAVE Act \u2014 is a response to a 2015 inspector general\u2019s finding that the Department of Homeland Security was wasting money by mismanaging its vehicle fleet.\n\nThe latest bill signed by Mr. Trump, the Securing our Agriculture and Food Act , directs the secretary of homeland security to take steps to safeguard America\u2019s food system against terrorism and makes a few other tweaks.\n\nCeremonial and Routine Lawmaking\n\nIn addition to signing two budget bills, Mr. Trump signed a bill to improve processing of pension benefits for police officers. And he signed a dozen routine or ceremonial bills that attracted little attention.\n\nOne law, called the U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act , declares that the \u201csense of the Congress\u201d is that the secretary of state should seek to rejoin the Bureau of International Expositions, which puts on world fairs.\n\nOne law established a name for a health care center in Center Township, Pa. Another named a community-based outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, the Faleomavaega Eni Fa\u2019aua\u2019a Hunkin V.A. Clinic . Another approved the location of a memorial to commemorate members of the military who served in Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump nominated Gen. Jim Mattis to be secretary of defense, he needed Congress to pass a law waiving the prohibition against appointing a defense secretary within seven years of the nominee\u2019s retirement from active duty in the military.\n\nMr. Trump signed that bill into law, too.\n\nMichael D.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take Trump\u2019s responses during a press conference with President Emmanuel Macron of France last week. (By the way, that trip was marked by an embarrassingly pronounced inelegance by Trump, from the casual sexism of commenting on the French first lady\u2019s body to the awkward testosterone-measuring handshakes.)\n\nTrump has several verbal tics. One is that when he\u2019s trying to flatter and finagle, everything is beautiful: countries, cities, people, bills, questions, even chocolate cake.\n\nAs The Washington Post pointed out last week:\n\n\u201cBeautiful\u201d is one of President Trump\u2019s favorite words. He\u2019s used it at least 1,500 times on Twitter and in speeches since he began running for office, according to the database at Factbase. He uses it indiscriminately, the way a teenager might use \u2018cool.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is a device rather than a descriptor.\n\nThere was more: During the press conference with Macron, Trump twice referred to the 39-year-old Trump Jr. (who is the same age as the Macron, by the way) as a \u201cyoung man.\u201d That\u2019s a stretch, but one used to make the Mini-Monster sound more innocent than his emails suggest he is.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt one point, Trump exclaimed: \u201cFrance is America\u2019s first and oldest ally. A lot of people don\u2019t know that.\u201d Actually, everyone who was awake in history class and reads books knows that. Alas, \u201ca lot\u201d is a relative term. More importantly, this is, I believe, projection, one of Trump\u2019s compulsive traits. What he is guilty of is exactly what he accuses others of being guilty of. I would wager that Trump didn\u2019t know that France was our oldest ally until preparing for this trip.\n\nTrump complains endlessly about the media using anonymous sources, but Trump himself is addicted to anonymous sourcing, as demonstrated during the press conference. Trump discussed the Russian lawyer who met with his son:\n\n\u201cSomebody said that her visa or her passport to come into the country was approved by Attorney General Lynch. Now, maybe that\u2019s wrong. I just heard that a little while ago. But a little surprised to hear that. So she was here because of Lynch.\u201d\n\nWho is \u201csomebody\u201d? Why are you repeating something at an official press conference with another head of state in another country that you freely admit may be wrong? And if you admit that it may be wrong, how can you state declaratively that \u201cshe was here because of Lynch\u201d?\n\nTrump also seemed to crack the door on revisiting his hugely reckless withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, but then added, \u201cBut we will talk about that over the coming period of time.\u201d What does that mean? It means nothing, is what it means. It means, \u201cI\u2019m saying things amenable to the French while I\u2019m in France because I\u2019m like a chameleon: a lizard who can adjust his appearance for his environment.\u201d That \u201ccoming period of time\u201d will never come.\n\nListening to Trump speak is a dizzying experience for anyone interested in candor, clarity or concision. It\u2019s as if he puts language through a meat grinder and what emerges is nearly unrecognizable, in either comprehension or certitude.",

While we should judge each individual on the totality of their lives (defenders of Lee, for instance, point to his attempts to be a figure of reconciliation after the war), the forces of hate and of exclusion long ago made Confederate imagery their own. Monuments in public places of veneration to those who believed it their duty to fight the Union have no place in the Union of the 21st century \u2014 a view with which Lee himself might have agreed. \u201cI think it wiser,\u201d he wrote in 1866, \u201cnot to keep open the sores of war.\u201d\n\nOf course, Lee lost that struggle, too, and my home state is dealing with just this issue at the moment. In 1973, the Sons of Confederate Veterans raised money to install a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Southern cavalry commander and early leader of the Klan, in the state capitol.\n\nIt\u2019s ahistoric to judge figures from the past by our own moral standards. Yet we need not contort ourselves to find Forrest wanting as an object of veneration. He was condemned for outrages and atrocities in his own time. One example: the massacre at Fort Pillow in April 1864, in western Tennessee, where Forrest\u2019s men \u201ccruelly butchered every colored soldier they could lay hands upon,\u201d according to a report in The Chicago Tribune not long after.\n\nMore than a century and a half on, the battle over Forrest\u2019s memory here may offer lessons for others. Taken as a whole, my state was always ambivalent about the Confederacy. In February 1861 a majority of its voters opposed a proposed secession convention, with pro-Union sentiment particularly strong in the more mountainous eastern region of the state. Then came Fort Sumter and the federal call to fight the secessionists, and secession carried the day at last.\n\nBy the end of the war, 120,000 Tennesseans had fought for the Confederacy, but a significant number, 31,000, took up arms for the Union. As historians have noted, that meant Tennessee alone provided the federal forces with more soldiers than all other seceded states combined.\n\nGiven its history during the Confederate era, then, Tennessee has the capacity to be more reasonable in the neo-Confederate one. According to a 2016 law, the removal of a monument like the one to Forrest requires either an act of the General Assembly or a two-thirds vote of the state\u2019s historical commission, most of whom are appointed by the governor. And the position of Gov. Bill Haslam, a popular Republican, is clear: It\u2019s time for the Forrest bust to go. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Nathan Bedford Forrest should be one of the individuals we honor at the Capitol,\u201d he said. \u201cThat history should be put in a museum, not in a place of honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will never be peace in Tennessee,\u201d Union Gen. William T. Sherman once said, \u201cuntil Forrest is dead.\u201d Like his more celebrated remark that war is hell, Sherman was onto something. The good news in this grim period of 2017 is that reasonable Southerners may be ready to give peace a chance.",

        "text": "Stocks slid on Thursday in part on worries that the president\u2019s ruptured relations with business would damage his plans to jump-start economic growth. The decline steepened after the terrorist attack in Barcelona.\n\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index closed the day down 1.54 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 1.24 percent. The closely watched VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, better known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, soared more than 30 percent.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House announced that a presidential advisory group on infrastructure policy and investment was also disbanding.\n\nA number of companies, including Merck, Under Armour, Intel, Pepsi, G.E., IBM and Johnson & Johnson, made public statements this week condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks that \u201cmany sides\u201d were responsible for the violence in Virginia as being at odds with their corporate values.\n\nSome of his supporters in the business world and several corporate members of the advisory groups, meanwhile, have not said anything publicly about Charlottesville.\n\nOne of the more vocal supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity giant the Blackstone Group, has condemned the events in Charlottesville.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs the one who conceived of and, at the president\u2019s request, led the most prominent of the shuttered White House councils, he has felt the recent tensions between corporate America and the president most keenly. Mr. Schwarzman, of all the council members, maintained the most consistent contact with the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to people who have spoken with him, Mr. Schwarzman was disappointed that the panel was not able to fulfill its ultimate function, which was to help the president deliver on his pro-growth promises by offering tips and advice from the front lines of business and finance.\n\nNow that the panel has disbanded, it remains unclear if Mr. Schwarzman will continue to discuss policy with the president.\n\nMr. Schwarzman declined to comment.\n\nThe unfolding corporate response to Mr. Trump \u2014 and the varied reactions by companies \u2014 reflects the constellation of outside pressures top corporate executives face today, management experts say.\n\n\u201cPrincipled stances are not common,\u201d said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cThey wait for public opinion to tell them what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cC.E.O. courage is in short supply,\u201d she said.\n\nThat is more the case these days than back in the 1960s and 1970s, when business leaders like Irving S. Shapiro of DuPont, Reginald H. Jones of G.E. and Thomas Watson Jr. of IBM often led public opinion, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management.\n\nSome business leaders, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, were advocates for the creation of federal environmental protection programs, and Mr. Jones of G.E. popularized the phrase \u201ccorporate social responsibility.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Thiel recently participated in administration discussions that resulted in a harder line toward China over possible intellectual-property violations.\n\nMr. Thiel has given no indication he is backing off from his support for Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment Thursday.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest allies in business come from the private precincts of Wall Street investors, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. They face few of the pressures that the chief executives of public companies must juggle.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s supporters in the hedge fund industry have included Paul Singer, Steven A. Cohen and John Paulson. And Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire investor, is an unpaid adviser to Mr. Trump on regulatory matters. (All did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nMr. Trump has long relied on a close and informal circle of advisers to give him a quick read on economic and financial matters. Among the more prominent in this regard is Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a billionaire real estate investor who has known the president for decades.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Barrack, who made his fortune snapping up undervalued real estate assets, is the executive chairman of Colony NorthStar, and has been a trusted confidant to Mr. Trump during the campaign and since he took office.\n\nKenneth G. Langone, billionaire co-founder of Home Depot and a prominent Republican fund-raiser, has been a vocal supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda.\n\n\u201cI had high hopes \u2014 the president has blown a great opportunity,\u201d Mr. Langone said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cHe completely mishandled the situation in Charlottesville. There was no gray area here \u2014 these people were repulsive.\u201d\n\nMr. Langone said that the president\u2019s provocative comments on the protests were a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d that would hurt his ability to address pressing national needs like infrastructure.\n\nStill, despite their building frustrations and disappointments, some Trump supporters may feel that they should stick by him, betting on his proven ability as a survivor.\n\n\u201cDo I have a choice? No,\u201d Mr. Langone said. \u201cI still believe he can get a lot done and he has an uncanny knack of surviving \u2014 I mean who would have thought he was going to win in the first place?\u201d",

        "text": "Photo\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump had promised that his mix of tax cuts, deregulation and reductions in wasteful spending would spur economic growth and cure America\u2019s ailing fiscal health. On Thursday, an independent government analysis of those proposals effectively said, \u201cNot so much.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office cast Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural budget as overly optimistic, expressing doubt about his promises to balance the federal budget. The budget projected that by 2027, the economy would achieve a small budget surplus. But according to the budget office, the deficit would remain at $720 billion, or 2.6 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nComparing Deficit Estimates How much the deficit is expected to grow under current law How much the deficit is expected to change under Trump\u2019s budget, according to: The White House Congressional Budget Office \u201917 \u201927 \u201917 \u201927 \u201917 \u201927 \u20131% of G.D.P. \u20132 \u20133 \u20134 How much the deficit is expected to grow under current law How much the deficit is expected to change under Trump\u2019s budget, according to: The White House The Congressional Budget Office \u201917 \u201927 \u201917 \u201927 \u201917 \u201927 \u20131% of G.D.P. \u20132 \u20133 \u20134 How much the deficit is expected to grow under current law How much the deficit is expected to change under Trump\u2019s budget, according to: The Congressional Budget Office The White House \u201917 \u201927 \u201917 \u201927 \u201917 \u201927 \u20131% of G.D.P. \u20132 \u20133 \u20134\n\nThe assessment comes after the Trump administration was criticized in May for releasing a budget that economists said relied on overly rosy growth estimates. It was also panned for using questionable math and offering minimal detail about the president\u2019s tax plan, a central component in Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for improving the economy.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons the Trump budget fell short is that the budget office did not agree that its proposals would generate as much economic growth as the White House has suggested. It said that the average gross domestic product growth over 10 years is currently 1.8, and that under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan it would be 1.9 percent \u2014 far lower than the 3 percent the administration assumes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe lack of specifics in Mr. Trump\u2019s plans was also a problem for the Congressional Budget Office.

They\u2019re leaders discussing a rise in fame and tourism, while the world is watching our island carefully to see if we\u2019ll still be here tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe threats of possible aggression against Guam \u2014 often referred to as the \u201ctip of the spear\u201d \u2014 have become a focal point of debate about the presence of United States military forces on the island.\n\nActivists who are advocating Guam\u2019s independence from the United States argue that the presence of the military installations has made the island a magnet for attack. Others contend that the presence of the United States defense system is necessary, given the threats in the region.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think Guam is being used as a kind of pawn in this game,\u201d said Robert Underwood, president of the University of Guam. \u201cI think it\u2019s like our role in life.\u201d\n\nMr. Underwood, a former Guam delegate to Congress, said Guam should find a way to take advantage of its relationship with the federal government if the island continues as the platform to project the United States\u2019 military power in Asia.\n\n\u201cI think we should get more out of this relationship than what we are getting now,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Calvo, however, told Mr. Trump that he had \u201cnever felt more safe or so confident than with you at the helm. So, with all the criticism going on over there from a guy who is being targeted, we need a president like you. So I\u2019m just so thankful. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re holding the helm.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump responded: \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a great job. You don\u2019t have to worry about a thing. They should have had me eight years ago, somebody with my thought process.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd frankly, you could\u2019ve said that for the last three presidents.\u201d",

        "text": "A White House official said there was nothing unusual about it. And in two tweets late Tuesday, Mr. Trump derided news reports about it as \u201csick.\u201d He said the dinner was not a secret, since all of the world leaders at the summit meeting and their spouses had been invited by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. \u201cPress knew!\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cEven a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!\u201d Mr. Trump added.\n\nWhile the leaders-and-spouses dinner was on Mr. Trump\u2019s public schedule, the news media was not allowed to witness any part of it, nor were reporters provided with an account of what transpired. Mr. Trump\u2019s traveling press contingent did note, however, that his motorcade left the dinner four minutes after Mr. Putin\u2019s did.\n\nThe dinner at which the private conversation took place stretched for more than three hours after a concert for the leaders and their spouses at the Elbphilharmonie, a concert hall on the banks of the Elbe River.\n\nIn the earlier, formal meeting, Mr. Trump said later, he asked the Russian president twice about his role in the American vote. Mr. Putin denied involvement, and the two men agreed to move beyond the dispute in the interest of finding common ground on other matters, including a limited cease-fire in Syria.\n\nThere is no official United States government record of the intimate dinner conversation, because no American official other than the president was involved.\n\n\u201cPretty much everyone at the dinner thought this was really weird, that here is the president of the United States, who clearly wants to display that he has a better relationship personally with President Putin than any of us, or simply doesn\u2019t care,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based research and consulting firm, who said he had heard directly from attendees. \u201cThey were flummoxed, they were confused and they were startled.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe encounter occurred more than midway through the lengthy dinner, when Mr. Trump left his chair and approached Mr. Putin, who had been seated next to the first lady, Melania Trump. It was described to Mr. Bremmer by other guests as lasting roughly an hour and not initially disputed by a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, disputed that account. He said Mr. Trump had described the exchange with Mr. Putin as purely social, and as lasting far less than an hour. \u201cIt was pleasantries and small talk,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. In a separate statement, the White House said the two presidents had spoken through the Kremlin\u2019s interpreter because the American translator with Mr. Trump did not speak Russian.\n\nExperts in United States-Russia relations said such an encounter \u2014 even on an informal basis at a social event \u2014 was a concern because of its length, which suggested a substantive exchange, and because there was no note taker or national security or foreign policy aide present.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Those inquiries have cast a shadow over what would normally be seen as an attempt at diplomacy between world leaders.\n\nThe evening after his two meetings with Mr. Putin \u2014 the first lasting 135 minutes and the second an hour \u2014 Mr. Trump returned to Washington. On the Air Force One flight back, his top advisers helped draft a statement about a meeting his son Donald Trump Jr. attended last year with a Kremlin-connected lawyer who promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cWe have the worst relationship as a country right now with Russia that we have in decades, and yet we have these two leaders that, for reasons that do not make sense and have not been explained to anyone\u2019s satisfaction, are hellbent on adoring each other,\u201d Mr. Bremmer said. \u201cYou can take everything that\u2019s been given to us, and it doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Tuesday, the Kremlin intensified its demands that the Trump administration return two compounds in the United States that the Obama administration seized from Russia last fall in retaliation for the election meddling. After meeting with Thomas A. Shannon Jr., the under secretary of state for political affairs, Sergei A. Ryabkov, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, said he had warned the Americans that there must be an \u201cunconditional return\u201d of the property or Moscow would retaliate.\n\nThe State Department said no such agreement was in store.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cThese deals, so to speak, are going to take some time,\u201d Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cNothing is coming together anytime soon.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump announced on Tuesday night that he planned to nominate Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former envoy to China and Singapore, as his ambassador to Russia. Mr. Huntsman\u2019s nomination has been expected for months, but the investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and whether it colluded with Russia are likely to figure prominently in his confirmation hearing.",

        "text": "The effort by Senate Republican leaders to remake the nation\u2019s health care system \u2014 which went well beyond the perimeters of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law \u2014 was in retrospect doomed from the moment it began, even with the wind of an unlikely win in the House at their backs.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Senate measure would impose annual caps on Medicaid spending, ending what has been an open-ended entitlement for the poor and disabled. The process bypassed committees, any public airing of the bill or formal bill drafting. Instead, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, farmed out the remaking of 17 percent of the economy to a small group of senators, all Republican white men. The bad first look did not fade.\n\nBut under fire for the all-male panel, Mr. McConnell reduced it to little more than a kaffeeklatsch, open to anyone who wanted to come by and chat health care.\n\nRepublican senators, reflecting the divide in the party, quickly formed two camps: those who wanted to squeeze hundreds of billions of dollars out of Medicaid, and those, mainly from states that had expanded the program, who wanted to preserve it. Both groups held constant meetings, with many usually conservative senators like Jerry Moran of Kansas and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa sliding into the moderate group\u2019s gatherings to quietly voice their own concerns.\n\nSenator Rob Portman of Ohio, in particular, formed the spine of opposition to the bill, and pushed for changes to reduce the cuts to Medicaid. In his state, more than 700,000 low-income people have gained coverage through the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSenator Susan Collins of Maine criticized the Trump administration\u2019s often specious descriptions of what the bill would actually do, bolstering other more quiet critics\u2019 resolve.\n\n\u201cThe only change that Obamacare made in Medicaid was to give states the option of expanding coverage with increased federal funding,\u201d said Ms. Collins, who opposed the Senate legislation. \u201cYet the Senate bill would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars from this program, imposed an entirely new formula and reduced the reimbursement rate below the cost of medical inflation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe changes, she added, \u201cwould have been made without the Senate holding a single hearing to evaluate the consequences on some of our most vulnerable citizens, rural hospitals and nursing homes.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nMr. McConnell in the meantime did not have enough reliable allies on the right. Mr. Paul made it clear from the start that he would not support anything but a full repeal of the law. Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas had repeated conversations with Republican leaders and the White House about how to make the bill sufficiently conservative. Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, dealt an early blow by suggesting he would not support the bill.\n\nMaking matters worse for the White House, the bill had virtually no support from health care, insurance, patient advocate and disease groups, and was harshly judged by the Congressional Budget Office. Grass-roots opposition to the bill \u2014 aided by Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York \u2014 swayed members of Congress in a way rarely seen on Capitol Hill.\n\nAt the annual meeting of the American Hospital Association in May, Mr. Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, urged hospital executives to mobilize their employees in an effort to defeat the bill, which had been approved by the House just a few days earlier.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cYou have every right to express your outrage on behalf of the people who you take care of and your employees,\u201d Mr. Schumer told hospital leaders. \u201cEveryone needs to speak up and let their elected officials know how bad this bill is.\u201d\n\nThe final efforts for the bill began to unravel over the weekend as several Republican senators began to balk at the legislation. Although the Trump administration had dispatched Seema Verma, the new administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to the summer meeting of the National Governors Association in Providence, R.I., to try to persuade governors \u2014 and, by extension, the senators in their states \u2014 of the bill\u2019s merits, the governors remained unmoved.\n\nBy Saturday night, aides to Senator John McCain of Arizona, who is recovering from surgery, announced that he was unable to return from Phoenix this week, leaving Republican leaders another vote short.\n\nBy Monday night, as Mr. Trump was meeting with the group of Republican senators at the White House \u2014 not one of whom was on the fence about the bill \u2014 Mr. Moran and Mr. Lee, two senators who were on the fence, issued statements saying they would not support it, a catastrophe for the White House.\n\nPhoto\n\nLate Monday, Mr. McConnell responded by vowing to pass a measure to repeal the Affordable Care Act now, then work on a replacement over the next two years. But on Tuesday, three Republican senators \u2014 Ms. Collins, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 told Mr. McConnell they would not support his last-ditch effort.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Capito has generally been an ally of Republican leaders on even really tough votes and once told colleagues that the nearly 180,000 people on Medicaid in her state outnumbered the total number of people who had voted for her.\n\nOn Tuesday in Kansas, citizen-activists like Courtney Eiterich, 42, of Lenexa, who has multiple sclerosis, were celebrating outside Mr. Moran\u2019s office in Olathe. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this level of political activism before,\u201d said Ms. Eiterich, who had been dogging Mr. Moran for months. \u201cBut if I\u2019m not speaking out, who\u2019s going to do it?\u201d\n\nMr. Kasich, who had been against the bill, was pleased with the outcome on Tuesday, and recalled conversations he had with Mr. Portman.\n\n\u201cI told him all the time, this is not just about opiates, though opiates are a big part of it,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about people who suffer mental illness or chronic illness. Rob was trying to figure out how to be constructive, but at the same time, he didn\u2019t want to be taken for granted in terms of his vote.\u201d\n\nPatient advocates, who had major concerns about the bill, were relieved.\n\n\u201cWe joined together in January over a plate of breakfast burritos, so we call ourselves the burrito coalition,\u201d said Sue Nelson, a vice president of the American Heart Association. \u201cWe wrote letters, we brought in patients, we talked to congressional staff until we were blue in the face. We provided members of Congress with hundreds and thousands of stories from patients to let them know how critical it was to preserve affordable health care for their constituents.\u201d\n\nNow what Mr. Trump once described as \u201can easy\u201d process appears destined to stall his policy agenda, and has damaged his diminished standing on Capitol Hill.\n\nStill, the White House is not giving up. Late on Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, announced that Mr. Trump was inviting all Republican senators to the White House on Wednesday \u2014 to talk about health care.",

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nHaving come into office boasting of his business bona fides, Mr. Trump was quick to forge ties with the corporate world. Central to these efforts was the formation of the business advisory groups made up of executives who would help shape policy discussions.\n\nDozens of prominent business leaders joined the panels, and in the first weeks of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, numerous meetings were held at the White House. Yet the early momentum dissipated and few meetings of the advisory groups have been held since.\n\nFor the chief executive of Intel, who stepped down from the manufacturing council on Monday, the journey from engagement with the new president to a public breakup played out over the course of months.\n\nBrian Krzanich, the Intel chief, was curious about the Trump movement and, during the campaign, planned to hold a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump at his home to hear his views \u2014 only to cancel it after an outcry in Silicon Valley. Nevertheless, when Intel decided to expand a plant in Arizona in February, Mr. Krzanich called Mr. Trump and joined the president to announce it at the White House, even though the long-planned project was initially announced with President Obama.\n\nYet Mr. Krzanich has publicly disagreed with Mr. Trump on key issues, like the president\u2019s proposed immigration ban in January and the decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords.\n\nThe president\u2019s response to the weekend\u2019s violence in Charlottesville, Va., was the final straw. In a thinly veiled reference to Mr. Trump, Mr. Krzanich wrote that he was disturbed by people in Washington who \u201cseem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them.\u201d In a nod to the protesters who challenged the white supremacists as well as to Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of Merck, who quit the council early on Monday in protest of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, Mr. Krzanich added, \u201cWe should honor \u2013 not attack \u2013 those who have stood up for equality and other cherished American values.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter deliberating over the weekend and on Monday with senior executives and other advisers, Mr. Krzanich notified the council of his decision in writing on Monday night and published a blog post explaining it.\n\nThe willingness of Mr. Krzanich and other C.E.O.s to walk away from the advisory panels highlights an uncomfortable reality for Mr. Trump: He billed himself as the businessman-president, but some executives no longer want to work with him.\n\n\u201cThis should be his strong suit: courting C.E.O.s,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cInstead, Trump finds himself with C.E.O.s not wanting to be in a photo op with the president. What should have been an honor has become an albatross.\u201d\n\nMany executives remain on the various councils, including the leaders of Boeing, Amazon and Oracle. And since taking office, Mr. Trump has met with hundreds of business leaders.\n\nSeveral people involved in the panels also say that they can have a real impact on policy. Earlier this year, members of one of the advisory groups urged the president not regard China as a currency manipulator. That input, from a group led by the Blackstone chief executive Steve Schwarzman, seemed to inspire a change of stance on Mr. Trump\u2019s part that may have smoothed relations with that country.\n\nEven those companies that decided to remain on the panels have debated about how to proceed. General Electric, which on Monday said its chairman, Jeffrey Immelt, would continue to advise the president, did so after careful deliberation.\n\nA handful of top G.E. executives worked on a statement that \u201cacknowledged what the company\u2019s values are,\u201d condemning bigotry and racism. They did not check with the board, but did consult with G.E. diversity groups, including the one representing African-Americans in the company, to ensure that the statement was in sync with \u201cthe pulse of the company,\u201d before releasing the statement, according to a person with knowledge of G.E.\u2019s thinking.\n\nThe president\u2019s business advisers are in a quandary, said Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford\u2019s business school. Among the considerations C.E.O.s must weigh when contemplating whether to step down from the advisory groups: the benefits of having a seat at the table, the political preferences of employees and customers, and the potential consequences of slighting the president.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier, and it\u2019s less offensive, to not take the position in the first place, than to take it and to, relatively quickly \u2014 six months later \u2014 say, \u2018Whoops, I\u2019m out of here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pfeffer said. \u201cNow you\u2019re offending him. So I\u2019m sure the calculus changes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Frazier of Merck, Kevin Plank of Under Armour and Mr. Krzanich of Intel stepped down from the manufacturing council. And Tuesday morning, Scott Paul, the president of the American Alliance for Manufacturing, a nonprofit group, said on Twitter that he, too, was stepping down from the manufacturing council \u201cbecause it\u2019s the right thing for me to do.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Trump on Tuesday equivocated in his criticism of far-right hate groups, Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and Thea Lee, the deputy chief of staff, also stepped down.\n\n\u201cWe cannot sit on a council for a president who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism,\u201d Mr. Trumka said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s remarks today repudiate his forced remarks yesterday about the KKK and neo-Nazis. We must resign on behalf of America\u2019s working people, who reject all notions of legitimacy of these bigoted groups.\u201d\n\nCrossing a famously sensitive president has its risks.\n\nDuring the news conference Tuesday, Trump again took aim at Merck, criticizing the company for manufacturing its products overseas. \u201cWe want products made in the country,\u201d he said during the news conference. On Monday, he similarly accused the company on Twitter of \u201ctaking jobs out of the U.S.\u201d\n\nA company spokeswoman declined to comment on Trump\u2019s claim that the company was moving jobs abroad.\n\nSome companies on the council, including Boeing and Lockheed Martin, do substantial business with the government, adding another complex dynamic to their calculations. But the consensus among business leaders was that the risks of crossing Mr. Trump had diminished in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe risk calculus has changed dramatically,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University Business School, who sits on several corporate boards. \u201cYes, you may risk a tweet from Trump. But his tweets are increasingly flaccid.\u201d",

        "text": "\u201cThat\u2019s something that the Department of Defense and the White House will have to work together as implementation takes place and is done so lawfully,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said.\n\nStill, the announcement pleased elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s base who have been dismayed to see the president break so bitterly in recent days with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a hard-line conservative.\n\nCivil rights and transgender advocacy groups denounced the policy, with some vowing to challenge it in court. Pentagon officials expressed dismay that the president\u2019s tweets could open them to lawsuits.\n\nThe ban would reverse the gradual transformation of the military under President Barack Obama, whose administration announced last year that transgender people could serve openly in the military. Mr. Obama\u2019s defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, also opened all combat roles to women and appointed the first openly gay Army secretary.\n\nAnd it represented a stark turnabout for Mr. Trump, who billed himself during the campaign as an ally of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.\n\nThe president, Ms. Sanders said, had concluded that allowing transgender people to serve openly \u201cerodes military readiness and unit cohesion, and made the decision based on that.\u201d\n\nMr. Mattis, who was on vacation, was silent on the new policy. People close to the defense secretary said he was appalled that Mr. Trump chose to unveil his decision in tweets, in part because of the message they sent to transgender active-duty service members, including those deployed overseas, that they were suddenly no longer welcome.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe policy would affect only a small portion of the approximately 1.3 million active-duty members of the military. Some 2,000 to 11,000 active-duty troops are transgender, according to a 2016 RAND Corporation study commissioned by the Pentagon, though estimates of the number of transgender service members have varied widely, and are sometimes as high as 15,000.\n\nThe study found that allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military would \u201chave minimal impact on readiness and health care costs\u201d for the Pentagon. It estimated that health care costs would rise $2.4 million to $8.4 million a year, representing an infinitesimal 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in spending. Citing research into other countries that allow transgender people to serve, the study projected \u201clittle or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness\u201d in the United States.\n\nLt. Commander Blake Dremann, a Navy supply corps officer who is transgender, said he found out his job was in danger when he turned on CNN on Wednesday morning. Commander Dremann came out as transgender to his commanders in 2015, and said they had been supportive of him.\n\nHe refused to criticize Mr. Trump \u2014 \u201cwe don\u2019t criticize our commander in chief,\u201d he said \u2014 but said the policy shift \u201cis singling out a specific population in the military, who had been assured we were doing everything appropriate to continue our honorable service.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd I will continue to do so, until the military tells me to hang up my boots.\u201d\n\nThe announcement came amid the debate on Capitol Hill over the Obama-era practice of requiring the Pentagon to pay for medical treatment related to gender transition. Representative Vicky Hartzler, Republican of Missouri, has proposed an amendment to the spending bill that would bar the Pentagon from spending money on transition surgery or related hormone therapy, and other Republicans have pressed for similar provisions.\n\nMr. Mattis had worked behind the scenes to keep such language out of legislation, quietly lobbying Republican lawmakers not to attach the prohibitions, according to congressional and defense officials.\n\nBut Mr. Trump was concerned that the transgender medical care issue could imperil the security spending measure, which also contains $1.6 billion for the border wall that he has championed, and wanted to resolve the dispute cleanly and straightforwardly, according to a person familiar with his thinking, who insisted on anonymity to describe it. That prompted his ban.\n\nRepublican congressional leaders were aware Mr. Trump was looking into whether taxpayer money should be spent on medical procedures for transgender service members, but had not expected him to go so far as to bar transgender people from serving altogether.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump and Republican lawmakers had come under pressure from Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, a leading Christian conservative group, and an ally of Mr. Trump\u2019s. Mr. Perkins opposed the bill over spending on transgender medical costs and lobbied lawmakers to do the same.\n\n\u201cGrant repentance to President Trump and Secretary Mattis for even considering to keep this wicked policy in place,\u201d the Family Research Council said in one of its daily prayers last week. \u201cGrant them understanding, courage and willpower to stand up to the forces of darkness that gave birth to it and wholly to repeal it.\u201d\n\nOpponents of allowing openly transgender service members had raised a number of concerns, including what they said was the questionable psychological fitness of those troops. They said the military was being used for social experimentation at the expense of national security.\n\n\u201cThis was Ash Carter on his way out the door pulling the pin on a cultural grenade,\u201d Mr. Perkins said on Wednesday. \u201cOur military leaders are saying this doesn\u2019t help make us a better fighting force; it\u2019s a distraction; it\u2019s taking up limited resources.\u201d\n\nMr. Carter objected to the decision, for its effect on the military and on those considering joining.\n\n\u201cTo choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThere are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably. This action would also send the wrong signal to a younger generation thinking about military service.\u201d\n\nWhile some conservative lawmakers, including Ms. Hartzler, praised Mr. Trump, the president drew bipartisan condemnation on Capitol Hill and outrage from civil rights and transgender advocacy groups.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

At the time, Mr. Mattis said the delay would give military leaders a chance to review the shift\u2019s potential impact. Mr. Mattis\u2019s decision was seen as a pause to \u201cfinesse\u201d the issue, one official said, not a prelude to an outright ban.\n\nThe delay on recruits \u201cwas largely based on a disagreement on the science of how mental health care and hormone therapy for transgender individuals would help solve the medical issues that are associated with gender dysphoria,\u201d Gen. Paul Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during his reconfirmation hearing last week.\n\n\u201cI am an advocate of every qualified person who can meet the physical standards to serve in our uniformed services to be able to do so,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Mattis, a retired Marine, has not been a major proponent of allowing transgender people to serve in the military, in part because medical accommodations, including hormone injections, could open the Defense Department to claims from other people not allowed to serve, like Type 1 diabetics, who also need regular injections.\n\nBut Mr. Mattis and the Pentagon\u2019s military leadership all seemed to have accepted that transgender people already serving in the military would be allowed to remain. A senior adviser to Mr. Mattis, Sally Donnelly, represented the Palm Center, an organization that advocated on behalf of the L.G.B.T. community in the military during the debate that led up to the Obama administration\u2019s decision to allow transgender people to serve, defense officials said.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s abrupt decision is likely to end up in court; OutServe-SLDN, a nonprofit group that represents gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in the military, immediately vowed to sue.\n\n\u201cWe have transgender individuals who serve in elite SEAL teams, who are working in a time of war to defend our country, and now you\u2019re going to kick them out?\u201d Matthew F. Thorn, executive director of OutServe, said in an interview.",

        "text": "The junior Mr. Trump has said he accepted the meeting, which included two high-ranking aides of his father\u2019s campaign, after an email from an associate had said that someone advertised as a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d would deliver information compiled by the Russian state prosecutor that was damaging to Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt is not known exactly what Ms. Veselnitskaya said in the roughly 30-minute meeting. Donald Trump Jr. said she spent much of the time attacking American sanctions. Ms. Veselnitskaya has denied that, at the behest of Russian officials, she discussed compromising material with members of the Trump campaign team.\n\nDmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, told reporters that the Kremlin had never heard of her. Asked about possible links between Ms. Veselnitskaya and the Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, the ministry\u2019s spokeswoman, said that it had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with her efforts.\n\nBut in Russia, lines between career, loyalty and government service tend to blur more than in other countries.\n\nMs. Veselnitskaya built her career in the sharp-elbowed struggle for land as the Moscow suburbs expanded, as once derelict factory sites and other plots became wildly valuable with the spread of shopping centers and new highways. And she forged an important connection to the Katsyv family.\n\nWilliam Browder, an American-born hedge fund manager who has tussled repeatedly with Ms. Veselnitskaya, said of the elder Mr. Katsyv: \u201cIn the world of Russia he\u2019d be the equivalent of a Chris Christie: no formal relationship to the Kremlin, but with very strong relations to the powers that be.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s trust in Ms. Veselnitskaya was rewarded in May, when she helped Denis P. Katsyv, Pyotr\u2019s son, fight the money laundering claims in New York brought by the Manhattan federal prosecutor at the time, Preet Bharara. Mr. Bharara tangled with Ms. Veselnitskaya several times and protested at one point that she had been charging the government for a $995-a-night room at the Plaza Hotel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe case was settled two months after Mr. Bharara was dismissed by President Trump.\n\nPrevezon Holdings, Mr. Katsyv\u2019s company, paid $6 million to resolve the claim without admitting any crime. While the prosecution portrayed the settlement as a victory, Ms. Veselnitskaya told the newspaper Izvestia that it was \u201calmost an apology from the government.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, she had become the public face of Moscow\u2019s efforts to reverse international travel and financial sanctions on key Russian figures linked to an alleged $230 million tax fraud.\n\nSergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who exposed the fraud, was arrested by the same prosecutors who he suggested had organized it. He died in jail in 2009 amid accusations of beatings and medical malpractice.\n\nIn 2012 Mr. Browder, who had been Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s boss, successfully campaigned for the United States Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act, a collection of sanctions naming Russian officials linked to Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s death. An outraged Mr. Putin responded by banning Americans from adopting Russian children.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Veselnitskaya has also met with members of Congress and helped to establish a Delaware nonprofit group that lobbied against the sanctions. She submitted lengthy testimony and organized a screening of an anti-Magnitsky film at Newseum in Washington in June 2016, just days after she met with Donald Trump Jr.\n\nShe also attended a congressional committee hearing on American policy toward Russia a day after the screening, taking a front-row seat.\n\n\u201cShe has this kind of patriotic thing about her,\u201d said Andrei Nekrasov, the Russian documentary maker who made the film, which critics called inaccurate. \u201cShe does have a tendency to go a bit solemn, if not pompous and say \u2018My country is being attacked\u2019 \u2014 that is her style.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIt was Ms. Veselnitskaya\u2019s desire to get the United States to reverse the Magnitsky Act that prompted her to seek a meeting with the Trump campaign, she said Saturday in written responses to questions from The New York Times. On Tuesday, her office withdrew the promise of an interview.\n\nMs. Veselnitskaya started her career in the prosecutor\u2019s office in Moscow\u2019s suburbs before branching out. She earned a reputation as a fearsome opponent, intimidating both inside the courtroom and in the corridors, where she was known to threaten adversaries with the wrath of the government. By her own account in a recent United States legal filing, she said she had argued and won more than 300 cases.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne lawyer who has opposed her in court described her technique as 20 percent law, at which she excelled, and 80 percent acting. She would wave her hands and describe the travails of her victims in emotional terms, the lawyer said, who feared using his name for the safety of his family.\n\nMr. Putin\u2019s government has long been criticized as favoring an elite of loyal and trustworthy insiders who are permitted to manipulate the courts and government agencies to promote their interests \u2014 so long as they toe the Kremlin line. Ms. Veselnitskaya, lawyers and others who have followed her career said, was well versed in this game and wielded its weapons in the mad dash for real estate profits in the Moscow region that often pitted factions of current and former regional officials against one another.\n\nIn one instance, a small nonprofit, Spravedlivost, that tried to expose corruption in the Moscow region, published a series of articles accusing a group that included Ms. Veselnitskaya, her former husband, Aleksandr Mitusov, and Mr. Katsyv of being corporate raiders who used their clout in the regional government and the courts to seize valuable land.\n\nMs. Veselnitskaya helped bring a defamation suit against the nonprofit and the factory owner who had accused her of grabbing property. The court hit the representatives of Spravedlivost and the factory owner with hefty fines.\n\nIn 2008, her work with her stepdaughter attracted the attention of Vladimir R. Soloviev, now a well-known talk show host on state-run television.\n\n\u201cThey were involved in several very similar and very dubious stories,\u201d Mr. Soloviev wrote in a much-shared blog post about the spread of corporate raiding in Russia. \u201cInternecine strife, strange court decisions, documents that appear from nowhere and, as a rule, all connected with land plots in the Moscow region.\u201d\n\nIn another such case, Ms. Veselnitskaya took on Ikea, claiming that some of the land under an office complex owned by the Swedish company on the outskirts of Moscow belonged to an old farming cooperative.\n\nIt was one of many cases brought against the Swedish giant, and a former board member said they never could figure out who was behind them. This case was ultimately dismissed by the Russian Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEmails from the younger Mr. Trump released Tuesday indicate that the meeting with the Trump campaign was organized through Emin Agalarov, the singer son of the billionaire developer Aras Agalarov, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s partner in bringing the 2013 Miss Universe contest to Moscow.\n\nMr. Agalarov\u2019s fortune is based partly on giant shopping centers built around Moscow by his Crocus Group, whose work would undoubtedly have brought him into contact with Mr. Katsyv \u2014 and Ms. Veselnitskaya.\n\nMs. Veselnitskaya seems to revel in her emergence as a player in Russian policy. On her Facebook page, decorated with the Russian flag, she has a penchant for articles about conspiracy theories, and has often handicapped political developments in the United States like the appointment of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court or the dismissal of Sally Q. Yates as acting attorney general.\n\nWhen a friend wrote that she wished that Yuri Chaika, the Russian state prosecutor, had the same principles as Ms. Yates, Ms. Veselnitskaya objected, accusing the Americans of being corrupt. \u201cIn the United States, politics has long been the most lucrative type of business,\u201d she wrote.",

Kelli Ward, a former state senator who unsuccessfully ran against Mr. McCain last year, has already entered the Republican primary against Mr. Flake.\n\nMr. Graham said that White House advisers and political donors supportive of Mr. Trump were taking a close look at a number of 2018 Senate races, including those in Arizona and Nevada, to see where Republican incumbents might be replaced with people more supportive of the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf you have somebody that is, I will call it, an obstacle on virtually every aspect of an agenda,\u201d Mr. Graham argued, \u201cthen if this person gets re-elected, they have six more years where they will be in office and will likely maintain that same disposition.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump carried Arizona only narrowly against Hillary Clinton, but he remains popular with Republicans in the state.\n\nJosh Daniels, Mr. Flake\u2019s campaign manager, signaled in a statement that Mr. Flake, still in his first term, was confident of his prospects in the race.\n\n\u201cSenator Flake is a principled conservative fighting every day for the people of Arizona,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \u201cWe\u2019re building a winning campaign powered by strong fund-raising and a dominant ground game.\u201d\n\nIf the book may rankle some of Mr. Flake\u2019s critics on the right, his allies hope it will help address a more basic problem: He is a relatively undefined personality in Arizona and lacks the formidable profile of the state\u2019s senior senator, Mr. McCain.\n\nPausing under the scorching July sun to talk politics, Linda McSweeney, a Republican voter who works in business development, said she viewed Mr. Flake as a distant figure. \u201cNobody knows who he is,\u201d said Ms. McSweeney, 55, who described herself as having reluctantly voted for Mr. Trump last year.\n\nYet in what could be a hopeful sign for Mr. Flake, Ms. McSweeney said she would favor a risk-taker in the Senate race.\n\n\u201cI like people that take chances and shake things up,\u201d she said.",

        "text": "Photo\n\nWelcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep \u2014 and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.\n\nSoiling \u2018Organic Matter\u2019\n\nLike many news readers, Stephen Colbert had a lot weighing on his mind Tuesday. He was thinking about the rapid escalation in tensions between the United States and North Korea, and the Trump administration\u2019s reluctance to discuss climate change. He highlighted recent reports that the Department of Agriculture has told its staff to avoid using the term \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently, \u2018climate change\u2019 and \u2018climate change adaptation\u2019 are to be replaced by \u2018weather extremes\u2019 and \u2018resilience to weather extremes,\u2019 and the term \u2018reduce greenhouse gases\u2019 has been blacklisted in favor of \u2018build soil organic matter.\u2019 Do pants count as organic matter? Because today\u2019s news is making me build soil in them.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: While only 24 percent of Americans trust what they hear from the White House, Trump\u2019s approval rating in that poll is 38 percent. That means 14 percent of voters enjoy being lied to. And, if any of those people are tuning in right now, I just want to say: Everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT\n\n\u2018Fire and Fury\u2019\n\nAs the confrontation with North Korea escalates, Conan O\u2019Brien doesn\u2019t necessarily believe that Mr. Trump is ready to back up all his threats.\n\n\u201cToday President Trump warned that if North Korea does not stop escalating its nuclear program, quote, \u2018They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\u2019 Then Melania said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, he says that to me every night and nothing ever happens.\u2019\u201d \u2014 CONAN O\u2019BRIEN\n\nThe Punchiest Punchlines (Diptyque Edition)\n\n\u201cToday a Wall Street Journal reporter compared President Trump to a goldfish, because he forgets what happened 10 seconds ago. Trump was pretty mad \u2014 but only for 9 seconds.\u201d \u2014 JIMMY FALLON \u201cPolitical experts say that many members of Congress are preparing for a Mike Pence presidency. Yeah, they\u2019re preparing by binge-watching \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u2019\u201d \u2014 CONAN O\u2019BRIEN \u201cThe upscale fragrance company Diptyque is releasing a candle that they claim captures the scent of New York City. Yeah, nice try Diptyque, but I can pee in the corner of my living room for free.\u201d \u2014 JAMES CORDEN\n\nThe Bits Worth Watching\n\nApparently audiobooks for dogs are actually a real thing now. But these ones probably aren\u2019t.\n\nThis is not encouraging.\n\nWhat We\u2019re Excited About on Wednesday Night\n\nRobert Pattinson, the former \u201cTwilight\u201d star and the leading man in the celebrated new film \u201cGood Time,\u201d talks to Stephen Colbert on Wednesday.\n\nAlso, Check This Out\n\nPhoto\n\nDavid Letterman will soon be back on TV.

        "text": "Photo\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nConservative commentators are setting up former President Jimmy Carter as a Democratic whipping boy, to mitigate President Trump\u2019s governance problems. It is not true that Mr. Carter \u201cgot nothing done,\u201d as Ross Douthat states in \u201cThe Empty Majority\u201d (column, July 30), nor that he \u201cwas carried to the White House on the winds of change he did not fully understand,\u201d as Matthew Continetti claims in \u201cTrump Goes Rogue\u201d (Op-Ed, July 31).\n\nMr. Carter fully understood the conservative temper of his times, and his major legislative accomplishments are ranked by the Congressional Quarterly and the Miller Center of Public Affairs as among the very top of recent presidents, only slightly below Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s unmatched record.\n\nMr. Carter pushed through three comprehensive energy bills that laid the foundation for America\u2019s energy security today by deregulating natural gas and crude oil, stressing conservation and supporting alternative energy.\n\nTo actually drain the swamp after Watergate, he established strict limits on gifts; financial disclosure rules for his appointees and for himself; inspectors general in every department; and the independent Ethics Office, now under siege. He revolutionized America\u2019s transportation system by deregulating trucking and railroads, and brought air travel to the middle class by deregulating the airlines. He created the Department of Education and, with the Alaska Land Acts, doubled the size of the national park system.\n\nAt Camp David he produced a peace between Israel and Egypt that has grounded America\u2019s Middle East policy. The Panama Canal Treaty helped mend relations with Latin America. His tough response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan makes our current sanctions against Russia seem tame. Most important, he placed human rights at the center of his foreign policy, something future presidents ignore at their political peril.\n\nSTUART E.

        "text": "In May, in Israel, Trump insisted on a much shorter stop at Yad Vashem, an important Holocaust memorial and museum, than either Barack Obama or George W. Bush had made, and he stuck to that plan even as many Israelis and American Jews cried foul. The tone-deaf breeziness of his approach was accentuated by the message he left in the visitors\u2019 book: \u201cIt is a great honor to be here with all of my friends \u2014 so amazing & will never forget!\u201d As Yair Rosenberg of the Jewish magazine Tablet tweeted, it was \u201cbasically just what teenagers write in each other\u2019s high school yearbooks.\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump went to the Warsaw memorial in her father\u2019s stead, though Trump softened that blow somewhat by mentioning, in his big Warsaw speech, that \u201cthe Nazis systematically murdered millions of Poland\u2019s Jewish citizens.\u201d\n\nIvanka converted to Judaism to marry Jared Kushner, and the couple\u2019s key roles in the White House mean that Trump has observant Jews at the very core of his presidency \u2014 and of his life.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop him from making remarks to Jewish Republican donors in December 2015 that seemed to play into an anti-Semitic stereotype. \u201cI\u2019m a negotiator \u2014 like you folks,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cIs there anybody that doesn\u2019t renegotiate deals in this room? Perhaps more than any room I\u2019ve ever spoken to.\u201d\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, he embraced the favor of groups and people who trafficked in white supremacy. He re-tweeted material from proudly anti-Semitic Twitter feeds, and prompted a furor by promoting an image that placed Hillary Clinton\u2019s face atop a pile of cash and beside a six-pointed star on which \u201cmost corrupt candidate ever\u201d was written.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe website PolitiFact concluded that it was \u201cunlikely that the Trump campaign intended to put out a Star of David image. In fact, the campaign moved to replace the star with a circle when the image gained attention.\u201d Even so, PolitiFact noted, Trump had an unusual habit of \u201cusing social media to broadcast material that comes from sources with a history of spreading racism, anti-Semitism or white supremacy.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not convinced that Trump is much of an anti-Semite, any more than I\u2019m convinced that he\u2019s much of a homophobe. (Racism and sexism are another matter.) But I think he\u2019s so thirsty for, and intoxicated by, whatever love comes his way that he\u2019s loath to rebuff the sources of it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA prominent Jewish Republican put it well. \u201cI think Trump is such a pathological narcissist that the act of telling people who love you that you reject them \u2014 he can\u2019t get around that,\u201d he told me, interpreting Trump\u2019s reasoning this way: \u201cWhat can be wrong with them? They\u2019re for me!\u201d\n\nTrump is disinclined to denounce any constituency or tactics that elevate him to the throne, where he\u2019s sure that he belongs. The outcome validates even the ugliest and most divisive ascent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s goading these people or associating with them because he shares their views,\u201d the Republican added. \u201cI do think that he\u2019s so insensitive about the presidency \u2014 about the responsibilities of the leader of the free world \u2014 that he doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s not enough to say, once or twice, \u2018I don\u2019t agree with them.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t realize that you have to be very clear.\u201d And he doesn\u2019t realize \u2014 or care \u2014 that he\u2019s validating and encouraging them.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t understand the message of zipping through Yad Vashem when predecessors lingered, because he\u2019s less concerned with the weight of his office than with the whims and convenience of Donald Trump. It\u2019s all about him, always \u2014 and if he\u2019s sure in his own heart that he\u2019s good with Jews, then he shouldn\u2019t have to prove it.\n\nGo back to his mini-tantrum during a White House news conference in February, when a reporter for a Jewish magazine tried to ask him whether he was paying proper heed to the anti-Semitic bomb threats. Trump interpreted the question as an indictment not of his behavior but of his being \u2014 \u201cI am the least anti-Semitic person that you\u2019ve ever seen in your entire life!\u201d he trumpeted \u2014 and turned the discussion toward the big, bad media. Forget about any persecution of Jews. Let\u2019s talk about the persecution of Trump.\n\nYou can be only so considerate to others when you never stop considering yourself. And the flamboyantly nonconformist culture of Trump\u2019s presidency has downsides. This administration shrugs off and throws away some rituals and niceties that do matter to people, estranging them in the process.\n\nGay Pride Month came and went without even a banal word of recognition from the White House. So while Trump likes to crow, in a hallucinatory fashion, that gays love him, we made do in June with a tweet from his outsourced conscience, by which of course I mean Ivanka.\n\nSome of this is Steve Bannon and his ilk. Their idea of nationalism is chilly to the recognition of subgroups, including Jewish Americans.\n\nSome of it boils down to an absent professionalism. Trump isn\u2019t matching the respectful choreography of other presidents because there\u2019s no one in his inner circle familiar with the dance. Kushner, Bannon, Stephen Miller and Reince Priebus are all new to this kind and level of work. They lack institutional memory, along with any awareness of how easily those blind spots become insensitivity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI can\u2019t know definitively how Trump feels about Jews or gays or a whole lot else. But I can see clearly his sloppiness and self-absorption, and they\u2019re cause enough for alarm.",

        "text": "Our second-best-selling paper, The Daily Mail, specializes in hit jobs on public figures. Last year its front page proclaimed the High Court judges who had ruled that Brexit could be initiated only by Parliament to be \u201cEnemies of the People,\u201d denouncing one of them as \u201copenly gay.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Sun is even more expert at brutal sensationalism. In 2014, its former deputy news editor, Ben O\u2019Driscoll, told a court of \u201can enormous safe, about seven feet high,\u201d filled with some 30 years\u2019 worth of \u201ceye-popping\u201d material. The Drudge Report and Breitbart News look like amateurs and na\u00effs in comparison.\n\nBut it is Mr. Goldstone\u2019s second career, as a pop publicist, that is truly emblematic of the British media\u2019s evolution since the 1990s. It was then that celebrity journalism and a rich secondary market in P.R. took off.\n\nPiers Morgan was the poster boy for this phenomenon. He turned The Sun\u2019s show-business column, Bizarre, into one of the paper\u2019s most successful franchises, visibly mixing with pop stars, sports heroes, minor royalty and fashionistas. In 1994, Mr. Murdoch made Mr. Morgan, then age 28, the editor of The News of the World \u2014 and celebrity journalism came of age.\n\nPhoto\n\nUnder Mr. Morgan\u2019s editorship, a young Rebekah Brooks rose rapidly. Another friend, Andy Coulson, took over his role with the Bizarre column. Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson later became editors of The News of the World while Mr. Morgan moved to The Daily Mirror. During the trio\u2019s domination of the tabloid press, newspapers would spend millions on \u201cbuy outs\u201d from publicists, particularly \u201ckiss-and-tell\u201d confessions.\n\nLike hedge funds that speculate on derivative trades, celebrity journalism is a spread bet on the futures of public figures. Max Clifford, the most famous publicist of his day (until his downfall and disgrace as a convicted sex offender), used kompromat to ruin the reputations of several politicians, while his tabloid contacts helped keep his own clients out of the papers. The public appetite for such material spawned an industry of private investigators adept at the dark arts of bugging, phone hacking and acquiring confidential records.\n\nThe phone-hacking scandal in 2011 was a comeuppance of sorts. The News of the World closed; Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson both stood trial on charges related to phone hacking. In 2014, Ms. Brooks was acquitted, and a year later she resumed her role as chief executive of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s newspaper group. Mr. Coulson was convicted on a conspiracy charge, but not before he had served as Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s head of communications in Downing Street.\n\nMr. Morgan was by then working in the United States, thanks to another British innovation that had crossed the Atlantic: reality TV, exported in formats developed in Britain like \u201cBig Brother,\u201d \u201cSurvivor\u201d and \u201cPop Idol.\u201d\n\nMr. Morgan deftly surfed this new wave, serving as a judge on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d before taking over Larry King\u2019s spot at CNN. And, on the set of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d he met and, as he tells it, befriended Donald Trump. Until recently, Mr. Morgan\u2019s Twitter profile featured a photo of himself with Mr. Trump. In June 2016, just as Mr. Goldstone was setting up the Russian lawyer\u2019s meeting with the Trump campaign, Mr. Morgan was praising his friend\u2019s special talents among those \u201cskillfully manipulating the media to fuel their personal and professional brands.\u201d\n\nForget Shakespeare and Dickens, or even the Beatles and David Bowie. Today Britain\u2019s most important cultural export to the United States is the use of tabloid tricks and reality TV techniques for influence and profit. Rob Goldstone may look like a bit player in this story, but he is an avatar of the new power brokers in the age of politics as entertainment. Welcome to your new ruling class. Made in Britain.",

        "text": "Kazuyoshi Umemoto, Japan\u2019s chief negotiator, told reporters that the group of 11 \u201cachieved mutual understanding on a path forward\u201d without the United States.\n\n\u201cWe need a new international agreement,\u201d Mr. Umemoto said. \u201cI think we have reached a rough picture of what it will be like.\u201d\n\nMomentum for such deals has built in recent weeks, as big American allies have pledged their commitment to globalization.\n\nOn the eve of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, last week, Japan and the European Union announced the outlines of a broad agreement that would create a trading bloc encompassing $20 trillion in combined economic output. The deal was announced as the United States appeared increasingly isolated on issues like free trade and the environment.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly made clear his antipathy toward free trade, vowing to protect American workers and rebalance trade deficits with other countries. On Wednesday, the United States trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, sent a letter to the South Korean government saying that the administration was eager to revise a trade agreement between the two countries that has been in force for five years.\n\nIf Japan and the 10 other signatories are to keep the TPP alive, they would need, at the very least, to revise a clause that says the deal will come into effect only when ratified by six countries representing 85 percent of the combined economic value of the 12 original members. Without the United States, that threshold cannot be reached.\n\nJapan, which has the largest economy among the remaining trade partners, is pushing to preserve most of the ambitious rules that negotiators originally hammered out, as are Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe hope, of course, of Japan is to maintain the status quo of the already agreed framework, including the details,\u201d said Tomohiko Taniguchi, a foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nWhile optimistic that Japan could lead the group toward consensus, Mr. Taniguchi, who referred to the remaining TPP countries as the \u201cOcean\u2019s 11,\u201d acknowledged that the discussions would be challenging.\n\n\u201cNegotiations, once started, could turn in all sorts of different directions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gathering of 11, after all, self-centered, even selfish countries. All sorts of negotiations are likely happening.\u201d\n\nDeveloping countries such as Malaysia and Vietnam may want to renegotiate some of the tougher requirements that they accepted in exchange for the promise of access to American markets.\n\nThe agreement, for example, requires developing nations to reform child-labor laws as well as to improve the transparency of state-owned companies, and it permits drug makers in the large economies to extend patent protection on many pharmaceuticals that the smaller countries want to manufacture. Some of the developing countries may protest that such requirements are too onerous without the incentive of being able to export to American consumers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, when you take the United States out, the United States is two-thirds of the TPP,\u201d said Jeffrey Wilson, a research fellow at the Perth U.S.-Asia Center at the University of Western Australia. For developing countries being asked to make expensive overhauls, Mr. Wilson said, \u201cWhat is the point of the deal anymore?\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s goal is to preserve as much of the original deal as possible in the hope that the United States will eventually rejoin.\n\n\u201cWe should welcome the United States when the United States decides to come back at some time in the future,\u201d said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to Washington.\n\nSome observers see those hopes as na\u00efve. \u201cI think it\u2019s simply wishful thinking that the Trump administration will change its mind about the TPP,\u201d said Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors. \u201cSo long as he remains the president, I don\u2019t think he will actually make that turnaround.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOthers suggested that advisers to Mr. Trump might try to change his mind once he sees how difficult it can be to negotiate bilateral trade agreements. But in that case, they say, the 11 remaining countries should not alter the TPP.\n\n\u201cIf they try to renegotiate the rules or lower the standards, it will make it harder for the U.S. to rejoin the agreement down the road,\u201d said Bruce H. Andrews, deputy secretary of the Commerce Department in the Obama administration and now a managing director at Rock Creek Global Advisors, a consulting firm.\n\nAnd there is another reason the TPP countries should maintain the tough trade rules, Mr. Andrews said: to push China toward reform.\n\n\u201cIf TPP had gone into force, the Chinese, by necessity, would eventually have wanted to be part of it to enjoy its benefits,\u201d Mr. Andrews said. \u201cIn order to get into TPP, China would have had to do some serious economic reform and open their market from their current closed state. If TPP does not go forward as the model, China will likely get better terms from other countries without having to open its market.\u201d\n\nIn Japan, Mr. Abe has his own political reasons for wanting to push ahead with the TPP. Mr. Abe expended considerable political capital for the deal, going up against farmers who have traditionally supported his Liberal Democratic Party. The agreement would require Japan\u2019s closed agricultural sector to accept imports of rice, pork and other products.\n\nMr. Abe has also recently been dogged by influence-peddling scandals, and his party suffered a resounding defeat in a recent local election in Tokyo. By agreeing to the trade deal with the European Union last week, he was able to score a quick victory.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to keep that momentum,\u201d said Jun Saito, a senior research fellow at the Japan Center for Economic Research.\n\nJapan has indicated that it wants to secure an agreement between the remaining 11 countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership by November, when many of them will gather at a summit meeting in Vietnam.\n\nMost analysts say any agreement is unlikely to be completed that quickly. Still, said Shumpei Takemori, a professor of economics at Keio University, the reopening of negotiations allows Japan and its allies to \u201cshow the U.S. administration that we have alternatives.\u201d",

This is a president with no prior government or military experience who has shown no clear grasp of complex strategic issues.\n\nAs The Times reported Wednesday, his inflammatory words were entirely improvised and took his closest associates by surprise.

But when a reporter asked President Trump during a news conference for such a guarantee, he declined.\n\n\u201cWhat he said about \u2018not being in that position to discuss guarantees\u2019 is unbelievable,\u201d Marcin Bosacki, Poland\u2019s former ambassador to Canada, said in a radio interview. \u201cWho else is in a position to discuss those if not two heads of state?\u201d\n\nDonald Tusk, the president of the European Council and Poland\u2019s former center-right prime minister, said it was not an easy day for the Polish opposition.\n\n\u201cIt is obviously a diplomatic success when the president of the most powerful country in the world arrives in your country and says very nice things about Poland and its rulers,\u201d Mr. Tusk said in a Polish television interview.\n\nBut pro-government commentators were ecstatic about the president\u2019s speech for the way it spotlighted Poland on the world stage and for its full-throated embrace of the government\u2019s direction.\n\n\u201cThis speech was moving, and it was hard to keep emotions under control because the president hit Poland\u2019s most profound notes,\u201d said Pawel Lisicki, the editor in chief of Do Rzeczy, a right-wing weekly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an interview on state-controlled television, Mr. Lisicki also praised President Trump for \u201chis words about faith, references to God,\u201d something people notice in this predominantly Roman Catholic country.\n\n\u201cMy hope, which will probably remain unfulfilled, is that Trump ends all this drama with Russia, Germany, Britain, France and all the others,\u201d said Elzbieta Wielecka, 69, who came to Warsaw from Rybnik, a town in southern Poland.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m just not sure if Trump can deliver,\u201d she added. \u201cHe says one thing in one moment and then changes his mind in the next.\u201d\n\nSlawomir Kaminski, 46, had come with a big group on a bus from the eastern town of Pulawy.\n\n\u201cI am here because the most powerful politician in the world is here,\u201d Mr. Kaminski said, and because he agrees fervently with most of Mr. Trump\u2019s views. \u201cLook at him pressuring the NATO members to raise their military spending,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need.\u201d\n\nMr. Kaminski shrugged off worries that Mr. Trump would follow through and establish friendlier ties with Russia, enabling President Vladimir V. Putin to reassert Moscow\u2019s influence.\n\n\u201cOne should be judged by their deeds,\u201d he said. \u201cNot words.\u201d",
